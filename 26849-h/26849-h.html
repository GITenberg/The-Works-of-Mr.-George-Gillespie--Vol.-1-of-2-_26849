(Transcriber's Note: This book is an 1846 reprint of George Gillespie's
books, which were originally published separately.  Each is reprinted here
with its original title page and other front matter.  The paper book had
no page numbers; each book is transcribed here with its own page numbering,
which may have no correspondence with the publisher's idea of the page
numbers.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In presenting to the public, for the first time, a Complete
Edition of the Works of Mr <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">George Gillespie</span></span>, there are
two or three points to which the Publisher begs to direct special
attention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although the great value of Gillespie's various works was well
known to many, yet there had been no recent reprints of them,
and they had become so very scarce that it was with great difficulty
any of them could be obtained. Recent controversies had
brought forward the very subjects which had been so ably treated
by Gillespie; and it was felt, that justice to the Church of
which he was so great an ornament, and to the cause which he
so strenuously supported, demanded the republication of his whole
works, in a form, and at a price, which should render them
generally accessible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In prosecuting this task the idea was suggested, that it would
be desirable to publish what remained of those Notes on the
Proceedings of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, which
Gillespie was known to have written, if the permission of the
Advocates, in whose Library they were, could be obtained. That
permission was most readily granted. The manuscript volumes,
of what purported to be Gillespie's Notes, form part of the large
collection entitled, the Wodrow MSS. They appear, however,
not to be Gillespie's own Notes, but copies separately taken from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the original. The fact that they are manifestly separate and
independent transcriptions, furnishes good evidence of the genuineness
and authenticity of the original manuscripts, though it is
not now known where they are, if still in existence. In making
a new copy for the press every facility was granted by the
Librarians of the Advocates' Library, with their well-known
courtesy and liberality; and much aid was rendered by David
Laing, Esq., a gentleman thoroughly conversant with Scottish
ecclesiastical literature, and generously ready to communicate to
others the benefit of his own extensive and accurate knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Being desirous to render this Edition of Gillespie's works as full
and complete as possible, several small and comparatively unimportant
papers have been copied from the Wodrow Manuscript,
some account of which will be found at the close of the Memoir.
An appendix to the Memoir contains all that could be gleaned
from Wodrow's Analecta, as printed by the Maitland Club.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Memoir itself has been drawn up with considerable care,
and is as extensive as the paucity of materials for its composition
would admit. It might, indeed, have been enlarged by a
more full account of the great events which occurred during the
period in which Gillespie lived; but this would have been an
unfair changing of biography into history, and would not have
been suited to the object in view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the parts of the Collected Edition of Gillespie's Works were
issued successively, they have been paged separately; and may
be arranged in volumes according to the taste of their purchasers.
It will, however, be found most expedient to adopt a chronological
arrangement, such as is indicated in the closing pages of the
Memoir.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
George Gillespie was one of the most remarkable men of the period in
which he lived, singularly fertile as that period was in men of great abilities.
He seems to have been almost unknown, till the publication of his first work,
which dazzled and astonished his countrymen by the rare combination it displayed
of learning and genius of the highest order. From that time forward,
he held an undisputed position among the foremost of the distinguished men
by whose talents and energy the Church of Scotland was delivered from prelatic
despotism. Yet, although greatly admired by all his compeers during his
brilliant career, so very little has been recorded respecting him, that we can
but glean a scanty supply of materials, from a variety of sources, out of which
to construct a brief memoir of his life
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have not met with any particular reference to the family from which
George Gillespie was descended, except a very brief notice of his father, the
Rev. John Gillespie, in Livingston's <span class="tei tei-q">“Memorable Characteristics.”</span> From
this we learn that he was minister at Kirkcaldy, and that he was, to use
Livingston's language, <span class="tei tei-q">“a thundering preacher.”</span> In that town George
Gillespie was born; but, as the earlier volumes of the Session Register of
Births and Baptisms have been lost, the precise year of his birth cannot be
ascertained from that source. It could not, however, have been earlier than
1612, in which year his father was chosen to the second charge in Kirkcaldy,
as appears from the town records, nor later than 1613, as the existing
Register commences January, 1614, and, in the end of that year, the birth
of a daughter of Mr John Gillespie is registered, and again in 1610, of a son,
baptised Patrick. It may be assumed, therefore, with tolerable certainty,
that George Gillespie was born early in the year 1613, a date which agrees
with that engraven on his tombstone. Wodrow, indeed, states, on the authority
of Mr Simpson, that Gillespie was born on the 21st of January, 1613.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing has been recorded respecting the youthful period of Gillespie's life.
The earliest notice of him which appears, is merely sufficient to intimate that
his mind must have been carefully cultivated from his boyhood, as it relates
to the time of his being sent to the University of St Andrews, to prosecute
his studies, in 1629, when he was, of course, in his 16th year. It appears to
have been the custom of the Presbytery of Kirkcaldy, as of many others at
that time, to support young men of merit at the University, as Presbytery
Bursars, by means of the contributions of the parishes within its bounds. In
the Session Record of Kirkcaldy the following statement occurs, dated November,
1629:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Session are content that Mr George Gillespie shall have
as much money of our Session, for his interteynment, as Dysart gives, viz. 20
merks, being our Presbytery Bursar.”</span> In some of the brief biographical
notices of him which have been given, we are informed that during the course
of his attendance at the University, he gave ample evidence of both genius
and industry, by the rapid growth and development of mental power, and the
equally rapid acquirement of extensive learning, in both of which respects he
surpassed his fellow-students. That this must have been the case, his future
eminence, so early achieved, sufficiently proves; but nothing of a very definite
nature, relating to that period, has been preserved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When he had completed his academic career, and was ready to enter into
the office of the ministry, his progress was obstructed by a difficulty which,
for a time, proved insurmountable. Being conscientiously convinced that the
prelatic system of church government is of human invention, and not of Divine
institution, and having seen the bitter fruits it bore in Scotland, he would not
submit to receive ordination from a bishop, and could not, at that juncture,
obtain admission into the ministerial office without it. Though thus excluded
from the object of his pursuit, he found congenial employment for his pious
and active mind in the household of Lord Kenmure, where he resided as
domestic chaplain, till the death of that nobleman in September, 1634. Soon
afterwards we find him discharging a similar duty in the family of the Earl of
Cassilis, and, at the same time, acting as tutor to Lord Kennedy, the Earl's
eldest son. This latter employment furnished him with both leisure and
inducement to prosecute his studies, and that, too, in the very direction to
which his mind had been already predisposed. But, in order to obtain an
intelligible view of the state of matters in Scotland at that period, we must
take a brief survey of the events which had been moulding the aspect of both
church and kingdom for some time before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be assumed as a point which no person of competent knowledge and
candid mind will deny or dispute, that the Reformed Church of Scotland was,
from its very origin, Presbyterian; equally opposed to the prelatic superiority
of one minister over others, and to the authority of the civil power in spiritual
matters. This point, therefore, we need not occupy space in proving; but we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may suggest, that there is a much closer and more important connexion
between the two elements here specified, than is generally remarked. For,
as a little reflection will show, without the pre-eminence of some small number
of ministers over the rest, the civil power cannot obtain the means of directly
exercising an authoritative control in spiritual matters. Even the indirect
methods of corruption which may be employed can be but partially successful,
and may at any time be defeated, whenever the general body shall be restored
to purity and put forth its inherent power. A truly presbyterian church,
therefore, never can be thoroughly depended on by civil rulers who wish to
use it as a mere engine of state for political purposes; consequently, a truly
presbyterian church has never found much favour in the estimation of the civil
power,—and, it may be added, never will, till the civil power itself become
truly Christian. Thus viewed, it was not strange that the civil power in
Scotland, whether wielded by a regent such as Morton, or a king like James
VI., should strenuously and perseveringly seek the subversion of the Presbyterian
Church. In the earlier stage of the struggle, first Morton, and then
James, attempted force, but found the attempt to be in vain. At length the
King seemed inclined to leave off the hopeless and pernicious contest; and, in
the year 1592, an Act of Parliament was passed, ratifying all the essential
elements of the Presbyterian Church, in doctrine, government, discipline, and
worship. But this proved to be merely a cessation of hostilities on the part
of the King, preparatory to their resumption in a more insidious and dangerous
manner, and by the dark instrumentality of his boasted <span class="tei tei-q">“king-craft.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first indication of the crafty monarch's designs was in the year 1597,
when he, <span class="tei tei-q">“of his great zeal and singular affection which he always has to the
advancement of the true religion, presently professed within this realm,”</span> to
use his own words, enacted that all who should be appointed to the prelatic
dignity, should enjoy the privilege of sitting and voting in Parliament. The
pretence was, that these persons would attend better to the interests of the
Church than could be done by laymen; the intention was, to introduce the
prelatic order and subvert the Presbyterian Church. And, that this might be
done quietly and imperceptibly, the question respecting the influence which
these parliamentary representatives of the Church should have in the government
of the Church itself, was left to be determined by the King and the
General Assembly. Many of the most judicious and clear-sighted of the
ministers perceived the dangerous tendency of this measure, and gave it their
decided and strenuous opposition; but others, wearied out by their conflict
with the avaricious and tyrannical conduct of the nobility, which they hoped
thus more effectually to resist, or gained over by the persuasions of the King
and the court party, supported the proposal. The result was, that the
measure was carried in the Assembly of 1598, by a majority of ten, and that
majority formed chiefly by the votes of the elders, whom the King had induced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to support his views. Scarcely had even this step been taken, when the Church
became alarmed at the possible consequences; and, in order to avoid increasing
that alarm, all further consideration of the measure, with reference to its
subordinate details, was postponed till the meeting of the next Assembly.
Nor was this enough. As the time for the next Assembly drew near, the
King felt so uncertain of success, that he prorogued the appointed meeting,
and betook himself to those private artifices by which his previous conquest
had been gained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the Assembly of 1600 met, the most intense interest was felt by the
whole kingdom in its proceedings, all men perceiving that upon its decision
would depend the continuation or the overthrow of the presbyterian form of
church government in Scotland. The King's first step was the arbitrary
exclusion from the Assembly of the celebrated Andrew Melville. The discussion
commenced respecting the propriety of ministers voting in Parliament.
But when those who favoured the measure could not meet the argument of
its opponents, the King again interposed, and authoritatively declared that
the preceding General Assembly had already decided the general question in
the affirmative; and that they had now only to determine subordinate arrangements.
The measure was thus saved from defeat. The next question,
whether the parliamentary ministers should hold their place for life, or be
annually elected, was decided in favour of annual election. Yet James
prevailed upon the cleric to frame an ambiguous statement in the minute of
proceedings, virtually granting what the Assembly had rejected. Even then,
though thus both overborne and tricked by the King, the Church framed a
number of carefully expressed <span class="tei tei-q">“caveats,”</span> or cautions, for protecting her
liberties, and guarding against the introduction of Prelacy. It was not,
however, the intention of the King to pay any regard to these <span class="tei tei-q">“caveats,”</span> so
soon as he might think it convenient to set them aside; and, accordingly,
within a few months he appointed three bishops to the vacant sees of Ross,
Aberdeen, and Caithness, directly in violation of all the <span class="tei tei-q">“caveats”</span> by which he
had agreed that the appointment of ecclesiastical commissioners to Parliament
should be regulated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That mysterious event, the Gowry conspiracy, and the views taken of it by
some of the best and most influential of the ministers, tended to alter the
aspect of the struggle between the King and the Church; and though the King
twice interposed to change the Assembly's time and place of meeting by his
own authority, contrary to the provisions of the act, 1592, yet the church
succeeded in maintaining a large measure of its primitive freedom and purity,
against the encroachments of the crafty and perfidious monarch and his
<span class="tei tei-q">“creatures,”</span> to use their own phrase, the bishops.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Assembly of 1602, however, was the last that retained anything like
presbyterian liberty, and ventured to act on its own convictions of duty.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But, the death of Queen Elizabeth, and the accession of James to the English
throne, directed his main attention for a time to other matters, and gave
occasion to a temporary pause in his violations of all the laws which he had
repeatedly sworn to maintain. The pause was brief. The flattering servility
of the English bishops inflated his vanity to an extravagant degree, and
rendered him the more determined to subvert wholly the Presbyterian Church
of Scotland, and to erect Prelacy on its ruins. He had already presumed
more than once to postpone meetings of the General Assembly, by his own
arbitrary authority; he resumed this course, postponed the Assembly for one
year, naming another,—then prorogued it again, without naming another day
of meeting, which was nearly equivalent to an intimation, that it should
entirely depend upon his pleasure whether it should ever meet again,—directly
contrary to the act, 1592, in which it was expressly stipulated that the
Assembly should meet at least once a year. The most zealous and faithful
of the ministers were now fully aware of the imminent peril to which
spiritual liberty was exposed. On the 2d of July, 1605, the day on which
the General Assembly had been appointed to meet at Aberdeen, nineteen
ministers met, constituted the Assembly in the usual form, and while engaged
in reading a letter presented by the King's Commissioner, a messenger-at-arms
entered, and in the King's name, charged them to dismiss, on pain of
being held guilty of rebellion. The moderator appointed another day of
meeting, and dissolved the Assembly in the usual manner. This bold and
independent, though perfectly legal and constitutional conduct, roused the
wrath of the King to fury. Six of the most eminent of the ministers, one of
whom was John Welsh of Ayr, son-in-law of Knox, were confined in a miserable
dungeon in the castle of Blackness, for a period of fourteen months,
and then banished to France. Eight others were imprisoned for a time,
and banished to the remotest parts of Scotland. The severity of Robert
Bruce's treatment was increased; and six other ministers, who had not been
directly involved in the resistance to the King's authority, by the suppressed
Assembly of Aberdeen, were called to London, and engaged in captious
disputations by the crafty monarch, and his sycophantic prelates, in order to
find occasion against them also. The result was, the confinement in the
Tower of Andrew Melville, and his subsequent banishment to France; and
the prohibition of his nephew, James Melville, to return to Scotland.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having thus succeeded, by fraud and force, in cutting off the leading
ministers, James next summoned an Assembly to meet at Linlithgow, in
December 1606, naming the persons who were to be sent by the presbyteries.
In this packed Assembly he succeeded in his design of introducing
more generally the prelatic element, by the appointment of constant moderators
in each presbytery. Advancing now with greater rapidity, he instituted,
in 1610, the Court of High Commission, which may be well termed the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Scottish Inquisition; and in the same year, in an Assembly held at Glasgow,
both nominated by the King, and corrupted by lavish bribery, the whole
prelatic system of church government was introduced; the right of calling
and dismissing Assemblies was declared to belong to the royal prerogative,
the bishops were declared moderators of diocesan synods; and the power of
excommunicating and absolving offenders was conferred on them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The government of the Church was thus completely subverted in its external
aspect. Its forms indeed remained. There were still presbyteries and
synods, and there might be a General Assembly, if the King pleased; but
the power of presbyteries or synods was vested in the Prelates, and the King
could prevent any Assembly from being held, as long as he thought proper.
But the Presbyterian Church, though overborne, was not destroyed, nor was
its free spirit wholly subdued. When, in 1617, the King attempted to
arrogate to himself and his prelatic council the power of enacting ecclesiastical
laws, he was immediately met by a protestation against a measure so
despotic. By an arbitrary stretch of power, he banished the historian
Calderwood, the person who presented to him the protestation; but he felt
it necessary to have recourse once more to his previously employed scheme,
of a packed and bribed Assembly, in which to enact his innovations. This
was accordingly done in the Assembly of 1618, held in Perth, in which, by
the joint influence of bribery and intimidation, he succeeded in obtaining a
majority of votes in favour of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the five articles of Perth</span></span>,
as they are usually called. These <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">five articles</span></span>
were,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kneeling at the communion</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
observance of holidays</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">episcopal
confirmation</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">private
baptism</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and
the private dispensation of the Lord's Supper</span></span>. It will at once be seen that these
innovations were directly contrary to the presbyterian principle, which holds that human
inventions ought not to be added to divine institutions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was the last attempt made by King James for the overthrow of the
Presbyterian Church. It was but partially successful. Not less than forty-five,
even of the ministers summoned to Perth by the King, voted against the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">five articles</span></span>; and in defiance of the authority of the King, and
the Prelates, and the terrors of the Court of High Commission, a large proportion of the
ministers, and a much larger proportion of the people throughout the kingdom,
never conformed to these articles. Various attempts were made by the
prelatic faction to suppress the resistance of the faithful ministers and people.
At one time a minister who would not yield was suspended from his ministry;
at another, he was banished from his flock, and confined to some remote
district of the country. But all was ineffectual, although much suffering and
distress of mind was caused by these harrassing persecutions. Very gladly
would the ministers and people have abandoned the prelatised church, and
maintained the government and ritual of the Church of their fathers by their
own unaided exertions, had they been permitted. But no such permission
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id="Pgxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
could be obtained. They were compelled either to abstain from preaching
altogether, or to remain in connection with the Church. And even this
alternative was not always left to their choice. They were frequently kept in
a species of imprisonment in their own houses, not permitted to leave the
Church, and yet forbidden to preach, or even to expound the word of God to
the members of their own households. Such was the monstrous and intolerable
tyranny exercised by Prelacy in Scotland, in its desperate attempts to destroy
the Presbyterian Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Presbyterian Church has always proved to be not easily destroyed.
At the very time when Prelacy and king-craft were uniting for its destruction,
its Divine Head was graciously supporting it under its trials, giving it life to
endure them, and preparing for its deliverance. The sufferings endured by
the faithful ministers in many parts of the country, tended to make them
objects of admiration, love, and respect to the people, who could not but draw
a very striking contrast between their conduct, and that of the haughty and
irreligious prelates. But mighty as was this influence in the hearts of the
people, one infinitely more mighty began to be felt in many districts of the
kingdom. God was pleased to grant a time of religious revival. The power
of vital godliness aroused the land, shining in its strength, like living fire. At
Stewarton, at Shotts, and in many others quarters, great numbers were converted,
and the faith of still greater numbers was increased. A time of
refreshing from the presence of God had evidently come; and it soon became
equally evident, that the enemies of spiritual freedom were under the blinding
influence of infatuation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The younger bishops, inflated with vanity, acted towards the Scottish
nobility in a manner so insolent, as to rouse the pride of these stern and
haughty barons. But the prelates had learned from Laud, what measures
would be agreeable to Charles I., who, to all his father's despotic ideas of royal
prerogative, and love of Prelacy, and to at least equal dissimulation, added
the formidable elements of a temper dark and relentless, and a proud and
inflexible will. The consequences soon appeared. Charles resolved, that the
Church of Scotland should not only be episcopalian in its form of government,
but also in all its discipline, and in its form of worship. In order to
accomplish this long wished for purpose, it was resolved that a Book of Canons,
and a Liturgy, should be prepared by the Scottish bishops, and transmitted to
those of England, for their revision and approval. The book of Canons appeared
in 1635, and was regarded by the nation with the utmost abhorrence, both on
its own account, and as intended to introduce innovations still more detested.
What was dreaded soon took place. The Liturgy was prepared, sent to
England, and revised, several of the corrections being written by Laud
himself, all tending to give it a decidedly popish character. Some copies of
this production appeared early in the year 1637, and were immediately subjected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvi">[pg xvi]</span><a name="Pgxvi" id="Pgxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the examination of acute and powerful minds, well able to detect and
expose their errors, and to resist this tyrannical attempt to do violence to the
conscience of a free and religious people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The crisis came. A letter from his Majesty was procured, requiring the
Liturgy to be used in all the churches of Edinburgh, and an act of the
Privy Council was passed, to enforce obedience to the royal mandate. Archbishop
Spotswood summoned the ministers together, announced to them
the King's pleasure, and commanded them to give intimation from their
pulpits, that on the following Sabbath the public use of the Liturgy was to be
commenced. The 23d day of July, 1637, was that on which the perilous
attempt was to be made. In the cathedral church of St. Giles, the Dean of
Edinburgh, attired in his surplice, began to read the service of the day. At
that moment, an old woman, named Jenny Geddes, unable longer to restrain
her indignation, exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Villain, dost thou say mass at my lug!”</span> and
seizing the stool on which she had been sitting, threw it at the Dean's head.
Instantly all was uproar and confusion. Threatened or assailed on all sides,
the Dean, terrified by this sudden outburst of popular fury, tore himself out of
their hands and fled, glad to escape, though with the loss of his priestly vestments.
In vain did the magistracy interfere. It was impossible to restore
sufficient quiet to allow the service to be resumed; and the defeated prelatic
party were compelled to abandon the Liturgy, thus dashed out of their trembling
grasp by a woman's hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the state of affairs in both church and kingdom, when George
Gillespie first appeared in public life. He had already refused to receive
ordination at the hands of a bishop; he had marked well the pernicious effects
of their conduct on the most sacred interests of the community; and his strong
and active intellect was directed to the prosecution of such studies as might
the better enable him to assail the wrong and defend the right. His residence
in the household of the Earl of Cassilis, while it furnished the means of continuing
his learned researches, was not likely to change their direction; for
the Earl was one of those high-hearted and independent noblemen, who could
not brook prelatic insolence, even when supported by the Sovereign's favour.
The first production from the pen of Gillespie, the fruit, doubtless, of his
previous studies, was a work entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“A Dispute against the English Popish
Ceremonies obtruded upon the Church of Scotland.”</span> Its publication was
remarkably well timed, being in the summer of 1637, at the very time when
the whole kingdom was in a state of intense excitement, in the immediate
expectation that the Liturgy would be forced upon the Church. Nothing
could have been more suited to the emergency. It encountered every kind of
argument employed by the prelatic party; and, as the defenders of the ceremonies
argued that they were either necessary, or expedient, or lawful, or indifferent,
so Gillespie divided his work into four parts, arguing against their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvii">[pg xvii]</span><a name="Pgxvii" id="Pgxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessity</span></em>, their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">expediency</span></em>, their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lawfulness</span></em>,
and their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferency</span></em>, with such
extensiveness of learning and acuteness and power of reasoning, as completely
to demolish all the arguments of all his prelatical antagonists. The effect
produced by this singularly able work may be conjectured from the fact, that
within a few months after its publication, a proclamation was issued by the
Privy Council, at the instigation of the bishops, commanding all the copies of
it that could be found to be called in and burned. Such was the only answer
that all the learned Scottish prelates could give to a treatise, written by a
youth who was only in his twenty-fifth year when it appeared. The language
of Baillie shows the estimation in which that learned, but timid and cautious
man, held Gillespie's youthful work. <span class="tei tei-q">“This same youth is now given out also,
by those that should know, for the author of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘English Popish Ceremonies,’</span>
whereof we all do marvel; for, though he had gotten the papers, and help of
the chief of that side, yet the very composition would seem to be far above
such an age. But, if that book be truly of his making, I admire the man,
though I mislike much of his matter; yea, I think he may prove amongst the
best wits of this isle.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So far as argument was concerned, the controversy was ended by Gillespie's
work, as no answer was ever attempted by the prelates. But the contest,
which began as one of power against principle, ere long became one of power
against power. In vain did the King attempt to overawe the firm minds of
the Presbyterians. In vain did the bishops issue their commands to the
ministers to use the Liturgy. These commands were universally disobeyed;
for the spirit of Scotland was now fairly roused—a spirit which has often
learned to conquer, but never to yield. It was to be expected that Gillespie
would not be allowed to remain much longer in comparative obscurity, after
his remarkable abilities had become known. The church and parish of
Wemyss being at that time vacant, the congregation, to whom he had been
known from his infancy, <span class="tei tei-q">“made supplication”</span> that he might be their minister.
This request was granted, <span class="tei tei-q">“maugre St Andrew's beard,”</span> as Baillie says; that
is, in spite of the opposition made by Spotswood, Archbishop of St Andrews,
who knew enough of the young man to regard him with equal fear and hatred.
He was ordained by the Presbytery of Kirkcaldy on the 26th of April, 1638,
the celebrated Robert Douglas, at that time minister of Kirkcaldy, presiding
at the ordination; and was the first who was admitted by a presbytery, at that
period, without regard to the authority of the bishops. This, indeed, soon
ceased to be a singularity; but, it must be remembered, that though the
attempt to impose the Liturgy upon the Church had been successfully resisted,
the ostensible government of the Church was still held by the prelates, and
continued to be held by them, till they were all deposed by the famous General
Assembly which met in Glasgow on the 21st day of November, 1638. But
their power had received a fatal blow, and it could not fail to be highly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexviii">[pg xviii]</span><a name="Pgxviii" id="Pgxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gratifying to George Gillespie, that the first free act of the Presbyterian
Church, to the recovery of whose liberty he had so signally contributed,
should be his own ordination to the ministerial office.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From that time forward, the life of George Gillespie was devoted to the
public service of the Church; and he was incessantly engaged in all the great
measures of that momentous period. He, however, was not the man of the
age. That man was Alexander Henderson, the acknowledged leader of the
Church of Scotland's Second Reformation. And, as it is not our purpose to
write a history of that period, we must confine ourselves chiefly to those events
in which Gillespie acted a prominent part.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next intimation that we receive of Gillespie is in Baillie's account of
the Glasgow Assembly. <span class="tei tei-q">“After a sermon of Mr Gillespie,”</span> says Baillie,
<span class="tei tei-q">“wherein the youth very learnedly and judiciously, as they say, handled the
words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The King's heart is in the hand of the Lord,’</span> yet did too much
encroach on the King's actions: he (Argyle) gave us a grave admonition, to
let authority alone, which the Moderator seconded, and we all religiously
observed, so long as the Assembly lasted.”</span> This proves, at least, that Gillespie
was highly esteemed by his brethren, who had selected him as one to preach
before that important Assembly, notwithstanding his youth. It should be
added, that on consulting the records of that Assembly's proceedings, we do
indeed find Argyle's grave admonition not to interfere with the authority due
to the King in his own province, and the Moderator's answer; but nothing to
lead us to think that it had any reference to Gillespie's sermon. Baillie had
not, at that time, learned to know and appreciate Gillespie, as he did afterwards
and, as he had been somewhat startled by the point and power of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“English Popish Ceremonies,”</span> he might not unnaturally conclude, that
Argyle's caution against what might be, had been caused by what had already
been beginning to appear in the language of the youthful preacher.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The course of public affairs swept rapidly onward, though certainly not in
such a channel as to gratify the lovers of arbitrary power and superstition.
The King, enraged to find his beloved Prelacy overthrown at once and entirely,
prepared to force it upon the Scottish Covenanted Church and people by force
of arms. The Covenanters stood on the defensive, and met the invading host
on the Border, prepared to die rather than submit to the loss of religious
liberty. But the English army was little inclined to fight in such a cause.
They had felt the king's tyranny and the oppression of their own prelates, and
were not disposed to destroy that liberty, so nobly won by Scotland, for which
they were themselves most earnestly longing. A peace ensued. The King
granted that spiritual liberty which he was unable to withhold; and the ministers
who had accompanied the Scottish army, returned to the discharge of
their more peaceful duties. But this peace proved of short duration. The
King levied a new and more powerful army, and again declared war against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexix">[pg xix]</span><a name="Pgxix" id="Pgxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his Scottish subjects. Again the Covenanters resumed their weapons of
defence, and marched towards the Border, a number of the most eminent
ministers, among whom was Gillespie, being required to accompany the army,
and empowered to act as a presbytery. It was, however, judged necessary
to anticipate the approach of the English by entering England. This bold
movement changed the nature of the contest for the time, because the English
parliament felt the utmost jealousy of the King's despotic designs, and would
not grant him the necessary support. Negotiations for peace were begun at
Ripon, and transferred to London. This rendered it necessary for the Scottish
Commissioners for the peace to reside at London. Henderson, Blair, Baillie
and Gillespie accompanied the Commissioners to London, resided with them
there in the capacity of chaplains, and availed themselves of the opportunity
thus afforded, for proving to the people of England that presbyterian
ministers were not such rude and ignorant men as their prelatic calumniators
had asserted. The effect of their preaching was astonishing, as even Clarendon,
their prejudiced and bitter reviler, admits. Wherever they preached, the
people flocked in crowds to hear them, and even clustered round the doors and
windows of the churches in which they were proclaiming the unsearchable
riches of Christ. It soon became apparent that both the cause, and the men
by whom it was defended, were too mighty to be despised. Courtly parasites
might scoff, but the heart of England was compelled to know that living faith
and true eloquence are equally powerful to move and guide the minds of
men, whether on the bleak waste of a Scottish moor, or in the midst of a
mighty city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Soon after the return of the Scottish Commissioners and ministers, in the
Assembly of 1641, the town of Aberdeen gave a call to George Gillespie to be
one of their pastors. This call, however, he strenuously and successfully
resisted, and was permitted to remain at Wemyss. But next year, the
town of Edinburgh applied to the General Assembly, to have him translated
to one of the charges there, and this application was successful, so that he
became one of the ministers of Edinburgh in the year 1642, and continued so
during the remainder of his life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although Edinburgh had succeeded in obtaining Gillespie, the citizens
were not long permitted to enjoy the benefit of his ministry. Another
class of duties awaited him, in a still more public and important sphere of
action. It is impossible here to do more than refer to the great events which
at that time agitated not only Scotland, but also England. The superstition,
bigotry and intolerance of Archbishop Laud and his followers, combining
with and urging on the despotism of the King, had at length completely
exhausted the patience of the English people and parliament. Every pacific
effort had proved fruitless; and it had become undeniably evident, to every
English patriot, that Prelacy must be abolished and the royal prerogative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg xx]</span><a name="Pgxx" id="Pgxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
limited, unless they were prepared to yield up every vestige of civil and
religious liberty. They made the nobler choice, passed an act abolishing
Prelacy, and summoned an Assembly of Divines to deliberate respecting the
formation of such a Confession of Faith, Catechism, and Directory, as might
lead to uniformity between the Churches of the two kingdoms, and thereby
tend to secure the religious liberty of both. The Assembly of Divines met at
Westminster, on the 1st day of July, 1643. Soon afterwards Commissioners
from the English Parliament, and from the Westminster Assembly, were
appointed to proceed to Edinburgh, to be present at the meeting of the
General Assembly in August, and to seek a conference, respecting the best
method of forming the basis of a religious and civil confederacy between the
two kingdoms, in their time of mutual danger. These Commissioners, accordingly,
attended the meeting of the Assembly in Edinburgh, and the result of
their conferences was the framing of that well-known bond of union between the two
countries, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the Solemn League And Covenant</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“a document
which we may be pardoned for terming the noblest, in its essential nature and principles,
of all that are recorded among the international transactions of the
world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the main object for which the Solemn League and Covenant was framed,
was to secure the utmost practicable degree of uniformity in the religious
worship of both countries; and, as the English Divines had already met at
Westminster to take the whole subject into consideration, and had requested
the assistance of Commissioners from the Church of Scotland, the General
Assembly named some of the most eminent of their ministers and elders as
Commissioners to the Westminster Assembly. These were, Alexander
Henderson, Robert Douglas, Robert Baillie, Samuel Rutherford, and George
Gillespie, ministers; and the Earl of Cassilis, Lord Maitland, and Sir Archibald
Johnston of Warriston, elders; but neither the Earl of Cassilis nor
Robert Douglas went. Three of these, Lord Maitland, Henderson, and
Gillespie, set off for London, along with the English Commissioners, immediately
after the rising of the General Assembly; the other three, Warriston,
Rutherford, and Baillie, followed about a month afterwards. On the 15th of
September the Scottish Commissioners were received into the Westminster
Assembly with great kindness and courtesy; and, on the 25th of the same
month, the Solemn League and Covenant was publicly sworn and subscribed
by both Parliament and Assembly, after addresses by Nyo and Henderson.
It was not, however, till the 12th of October, that the Westminster Assembly
commenced its serious deliberations concerning Church Government, Discipline,
and a Directory of Worship, in the hope of arriving at such conclusions
as might produce religious uniformity in the Churches of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, if not also with the Reformed Churches of the Continent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Scarcely had the Westminster Assembly begun its deliberations, when it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxi">[pg xxi]</span><a name="Pgxxi" id="Pgxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
became abundantly apparent, that, however sincere its members might all be
in the desire to promote the religious welfare of the community, they were,
nevertheless, divided in their views as to how that could be best accomplished.
There were three parties in the Assembly, the Presbyterians,
the Independents, and the Erastians. Of these the Presbyterians<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> formed by far the most numerous, comprising at least nine-tenths of
the entire body. There were at first only five Independent divines, commonly
termed <span class="tei tei-q">“the Five Dissenting Brethren;”</span> but their number finally amounted
to ten or eleven. Only two ministers were decided Erastians, but a considerable
number of the parliamentary members, chiefly those who were
professionally lawyers, advocated that secular policy. The Scottish Commissioners
refused to exercise the right of voting, but were continually
present in the Assembly, and took a very prominent part in all its deliberations
and debates, supporting, as might be expected, the views of the Presbyterians.
The chief strength of the Independents consisted in the tenacity
with which they adhered to their own opinions, disputing every proposition
brought forward by others, but cautiously abstaining from giving any definite
statement of their own; and in the close intercourse which they contrived to
keep with Cromwell and the military Independents. And the Erastian party,
though few in numbers within the Assembly itself, possessed, nevertheless,
considerable influence, arising out of their reputation for learning, having as
their ornament and support, that distinguished man, emphatically called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
learned Selden.”</span> But the true source of their power was the Parliament,
which, having deprived the King of that ecclesiastical supremacy which he
had so grievously abused, wished to retain it in its own possession, and
therefore, supported the Erastian party in the Assembly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Numerous and protracted were the debates which arose in the Westminster
Assembly, during the discussion of the various topics on which these three
parties differed in opinion; and in all those debates no person took a more active
part, or gained more distinction than George Gillespie. His previous course
of studies had rendered him perfectly familiar with all that had been written on
the subjects under discussion; his originally acute and powerful intellect had
been thoroughly trained and exercised to its highest degree of clearness and
vigour; and to a natural, perspicuous, and flowing readiness of language, the
warmth and earnestness of his heart added the energy and elevation which
form the very essence of true eloquence. We have already referred to the
high expectations which Baillie entertained of his future career. But high as
these had been, they were far surpassed by the reality, as he himself declares.
<span class="tei tei-q">“None in all the company did reason more, and more pertinently than Mr Gillespie.
That is an excellent youth; my heart blesses God in his behalf!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Very
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxii">[pg xxii]</span><a name="Pgxxii" id="Pgxxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
learned and acute Mr Gillespie, a singular ornament of our church,
than whom not one in the whole Assembly speaks to better purpose, and with
better acceptance by all the hearers.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Mr George Gillespie, however I had
a good opinion of his gifts, yet I profess he has much deceived me: Of a truth
there is no man whose parts in a public dispute I do so admire. He has
studied so accurately all the points that ever yet came to our Assembly, he has
got so ready, so assured, so solid a way of public debating, that however
there be in the Assembly divers very excellent men, yet, in my poor judgment,
there is not one who speaks more rationally, and to the point, than that brave
youth has done ever.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot here follow the course of the prolonged deliberations in which
Gillespie so greatly distinguished himself; but there is one instance of his eminence
which has so often been related, and not always very accurately, that
it would be unpardonable not to give it here,—especially as some pains have
been taken to obtain as full and correct a version of it as is now practicable.
After the Westminster Divines had agreed respecting the office-bearers whose
permanent continuation in the church can be proved from scriptural authority;
they proceeded to inquire concerning the subject of Church Discipline. In
this the Presbyterians were constrained to encounter both the Independents
and the Erastians; for the Independents, on the one hand, denied any authoritative
excommunication or suspension, and the Erastians, on the other, admitted
such a power, but placed it in the hands of the civil magistracy. For a
considerable time the discussion was between the Presbyterians and the
Independents; but when the arguments of the latter party had been conclusively
met and answered by their antagonists, the Erastians hastened to the
rescue, and their champion, <span class="tei tei-q">“the learned Selden,”</span> came to the Assembly,
when the discussion drew near its close, prepared to pour forth all his learning
for the discomfiture of the hitherto triumphant Presbyterians. His intention
had been made known extensively, and even before the debate began, the
house was crowded by all who could claim or obtain admission. Gillespie, who
had been probably engaged in some Committee business as usual, was rather
late in coming, and upon his arrival, not being recognised as a member by
those who were standing about the door and in the passages, was told that it
was impossible for him to get in, the throng was so dense. <span class="tei tei-q">“Can ye not
admit a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pinning</span></span>?”</span> said he,
using a word employed by masons, to indicate the
thin slips of stone with which they pin, or fill up the chinks and inequalities
that occur in the building of a plain wall. He did, however, work his way
to the seat allotted to the Scottish Commissioners, and took his place beside
his brethren. The subject under discussion was the text, Matt. xviii. 15-17,
as bearing upon the question respecting excommunication. Selden arose, and
in a long and elaborate speech, and with a great display of minute rabbinical
lore, strove to demonstrate that the passage contained no warrant for ecclesiastical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiii">[pg xxiii]</span><a name="Pgxxiii" id="Pgxxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
jurisdiction, but that it related to the ordinary practice of the Jews
in their common civil courts, by whom, as he asserted, one sentence was excommunication,
pronounced by their own authority. Somewhat confused, if not appalled,
by the vast erudition displayed, even the most learned and able of the
divines seemed in no haste to encounter their formidable opponent. At length
both Herle and Marshall, two very distinguished men, attempted answers, but
failed to counteract the effect of Selden's speech. Gillespie had been observed
by his Scottish brethren writing occasionally in his note-book, as if marking
the heads of Selden's argument; and one of them, some accounts say Rutherford,
turning to him in this emergency, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rise, George, rise up, man,
and defend the right of the Lord Jesus Christ to govern, by his own laws,
the church which he hath purchased with his blood.”</span> Thus urged, Gillespie
arose, gave first a summary of Selden's argument, divesting it of all the
confusion of that cumbrous learning in which it had been wrapped, and reducing
it to its simple elements; then in a speech of singular acuteness and power,
completely refuted it, proving that the passage could not be interpreted or
explained away to mean a mere reference to a civil court. By seven distinct
arguments he proved, that the whole subject was of a spiritual nature, not
within the cognisance of civil courts; and he proved also, that the church of
the Jews both possessed and exercised the power of spiritual censures. The
effect of Gillespie's speech was so great, as not only to convince the Assembly,
but also to astonish and confound Seldon himself, who is reported to have
exclaimed in a tone of bitter mortification, <span class="tei tei-q">“That young man, by this single
speech, has swept away the learning and labour of ten years of my life!”</span>
Those who were clustered together in the passage near the door, remembering
Gillespie's expression when he was attempting to enter, said one to another,
<span class="tei tei-q">“It was well that we admitted the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pinning</span></span>,
otherwise the building would have fallen.”</span> Even his Scottish
brethren, although well acquainted with his great
abilities, were surprised with his masterly analysis of Selden's argument, and
looked into his note-book, expecting there to find the outline of the summary
which he had given. Their surprise was certainly not diminished when they
found that he had written nothing but, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Da lucem,
Domine</span></span>, Lord give light,—and similar brief petitions for the
direction of that divine Head and King of
the church, whose crown-rights he was about to defend.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Various other anecdotes have been recorded respecting Gillespie's singular
skill and ability in debate; but the preceding is at once the most striking and
the best authenticated, and may suffice to prove his eminence, both in learning
and in power of argument, among the Westminster Divines.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first part of the task in which the Westminster Assembly was engaged,
was the framing of a Directory for Public Worship. This having been completed
about the close of the year 1644, the General Assembly of the Church
of Scotland met on the 23d of January, 1645, to take this Directory into consideration,
and to give it their sanction, should it be found satisfactory.
Baillie and Gillespie were sent to Scotland, to be present at the Assembly,
that they might introduce the subject, and give any explanation that might
appear necessary, and to do everything in their power to procure for it the
desired approbation. In this they were completely successful, and the Assembly
passed an act sanctioning the Directory,—that act having been written, as
Baillie informs us, by Gillespie. Having accomplished the object of their
mission, they returned to London, where Gillespie was speedily engaged in
the Erastian Controversy, during which he produced his greatest work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have already referred to the distinguished ability with which Gillespie
encountered and defeated Selden, in the discussion which arose within the
Westminster Assembly itself. But the principles of Erastianism were entertained
by many who were not members of that Assembly, and were advocated
in other quarters, so as to lead to a literary controversy. The Rev. Thomas
Coleman, one of the Erastians divines, the other being Lightfoot, preached a
sermon before the House of Commons, on the 30th of July, 1645, in which
there was a peculiar display of Erastianism of the very strongest kind. This
sermon was printed, as were all sermons preached before either House, and
excited at once the disapprobation of all the friends of religious liberty. It
did not remain long unanswered. On the 27th of August, the same year,
Gillespie preached before the House of Lords; and when his sermon was also
published, he added to it an appendix entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“A Brotherly Examination of
some passages of Mr Coleman's late printed sermon.”</span> In this appendix
Gillespie not only answered and refuted Coleman, but turned his arguments
completely against himself. Coleman soon afterwards published a pamphlet
entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“A Brotherly Examination Re-examined.”</span> To this Gillespie replied
in another bearing the title, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nihil Respondes,”</span> in which he somewhat sharply
exposed the weak and inconclusive character of his opponent's argument.
Irritated by the castigation he had received, Coleman published a bitter
reply, to which he gave the somewhat unintelligible title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Male Dicis
Maledicis,”</span>—intending, probably, to insinuate that Gillespie's answer was of a
railing character. This roused Gillespie, and induced him to put forth his
controversial power in a singularly vigorous pamphlet, entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Male Audis,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxv">[pg xxv]</span><a name="Pgxxv" id="Pgxxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in which he took a rapid survey of the whole Erastian controversy, so far as
Coleman and some of his friends had brought it forward, convicted him and
them of numerous self-contradictions, of unsoundness in theology, of violating
the covenant which they had sworn, and of inculcating opinions fatal to both
civil and religious liberty. To this powerful production Coleman attempted no
reply; nor have its arguments ever been answered by any subsequent advocate
of Erastianism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But however able and well-timed these controversial pamphlets were, they
were not enough to occupy even the few spare hours that Gillespie was able to
snatch from his attendance on the business of the Assembly. He had planned,
and was all the while prosecuting, a much larger work. That work appeared
about the close of the year 1646, under the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Aaron's Rod Blossoming:
or, the Divine Ordinance of Church Government Vindicated.”</span> In this remarkably
able and elaborate production, Gillespie took up the Erastian controversy as
stated and defended by its ablest advocates, fairly encountering their strongest
arguments, and assailing their most formidable positions, in the frank and
fearless manner of a man thoroughly sincere, and thoroughly convinced of the
truth and goodness of his cause. As it may be presumed that the readers of
this memoir are also in possession of <span class="tei tei-q">“Aaron's Rod,”</span> we need not occupy space
in giving even a brief outline of that admirable work; but as we are convinced
that the Erastian conflict, which has been recently resumed, must still be
fought, and will be ultimately won, we strenuously recommend the studious
perusal of Gillespie's masterly production to all who wish fully to comprehend
the subject.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> One or two points of general information, however, it may be expedient
to give. In the <span class="tei tei-q">“Aaron's Rod,”</span> while Gillespie intentionally traversed
the whole ground of the Erastian controversy, he directed also special attention
to the productions of the day. This he could not avoid; but this has tended
unfortunately, to give to his work the appearance of being to some extent an
ephemeral production, suited to the period when it appeared, but not so well
suited to the present times. It addresses itself to answer the arguments of
Selden, and Coleman, and Hussey, and Prynne; and as the writings of these
men have sunk into oblivion, we are liable to regard the work which answered
them as one which has done its deed, and may also be allowed to disappear.
Let it be observed, that Erastianism never had abler advocates than the above-named
men. Selden was so pre-eminent for learning that his distinguishing designation
was <span class="tei tei-q">“the learned Selden.”</span> Coleman was so thoroughly conversant with
Hebrew literature, that he was commonly termed <span class="tei tei-q">“Rabbi Coleman.”</span> Hussey,
minister at Chessilhurst in Kent, was a man of great eloquence, both as a
speaker and a writer, and possessed no small influence among the strong-minded
men of that period. And Prynne had a double claim on public attention
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a name="Pgxxvi" id="Pgxxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both then and still; for he had been so formidable an antagonist of the
Laudean Prelacy, as to have been marked out by Laud as a special victim,—had
been condemned to the pillory, and suffered the loss of both his ears by the
sentence of that cruel prelate,—and had been rescued from his sufferings, and
restored to political life and influence, by the Long Parliament. He was,
moreover, both a learned man, an acute lawyer, and an able and subtle controversialist,
and his writings exercised at the time no mean influence. When
such men undertook the advocacy of the Erastian argument, encouraged as
they were by the English Parliament, it may well be conceived that they would
present it both in its ablest, and in its most plausible form. And it is doing
no discredit to Erastians of the present day, to say that they are not likely to
produce anything either more profound in learning, or more able and acute in
reasoning than was done by their predecessors of the Long Parliament, and
the Westminster Assembly. If, therefore, Gillespie's Aaron's Rod completely
defeated the acute and able men of that day, we may well recommend it to the
perusal of those whose duty it may be to engage in a similar controversy in the
present age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But while such were Gillespie's labours in the field of controversy, the value
of which could not be easily over-estimated, his memory would be grievously
wronged were we to regard him only as a controversialist. For although the
topics which first engaged the attention of the Westminster Assembly were
those on which the greatest difference of opinion existed, and to which, almost
of necessity, the public mind, both then and ever since, has been most strongly
directed, there was a very large portion of their duty, and that, too, of the
highest importance, and demanding the utmost care, in which a much greater
degree of unanimity prevailed. For a considerable time after the Assembly
commenced its deliberations, its attention was almost exclusively occupied
with the framing of Directories for public worship and ordination, and with
discussions respecting the form of Church government, including the power of
Church censure. These topics involved both the Independent and the
Erastian controversies; and till some satisfactory conclusions had been
reached on these points, the Assembly abstained from entering upon the less
agitating, but not less important work of framing a Confession of Faith. But
having completed their task, so far as depended upon themselves, they then
turned their attention to their doctrinal labours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The manner in which the Assembly entered upon this solemn duty deserves
the utmost attention, as intimating the earnest and prudent spirit by which
their whole deliberations were pervaded. They appointed a committee to prepare
and arrange the main propositions which were to be examined and
digested into a system by the Assembly. The members of this committee
were, Dr Hoyle, Dr Gouge, Messrs Herle, Gataker, Tuckney, Reynolds, and
Vines, with the Scottish Commissioners Henderson, Baillie, Rutherford, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvii">[pg xxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxvii" id="Pgxxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Gillespie. Those learned and able divines began their labours by arranging,
in the most systematic order, the various great and sacred truths which God
has revealed to man; and then reduced these to thirty-two distinct heads or
chapters, each having a title expressive of its subject. These were again subdivided
into sections; and the committee formed themselves into several subcommittees,
each of which took a specific topic for the sake of exact and
concentrated deliberation. When these sub-committees had completed their
respective tasks, the whole results were laid before the entire committee, and
any alterations suggested and debated till all were of one mind. And when
any title, or chapter, had been thus fully prepared by the committee, it was
reported to the Assembly, and again subjected to the most minute and careful
investigation, in every paragraph, sentence, and even word. All that
learning the most profound, intellect the most searching, and piety the most
sincere could accomplish, was thus concentrated in the Westminster Assembly's
Confession of Faith, which may be safely termed the most perfect statement
of systematic Theology ever framed by the Christian Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the preliminary deliberations of the Committee the Scottish divines took
a leading part, and none more than Gillespie. But no report of these deliberations
either was or could be made public. The results alone appeared when
the Committee, from time to time, laid its matured propositions before the
Assembly. And it is gratifying to be able to add, that throughout the
deliberations of the Assembly itself, when composing, or rather, formally
sanctioning the Confession of Faith, there prevailed almost an entire and
perfect harmony. There appears, indeed, to have been only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> subjects on
which any difference of opinion existed among them. The one of these was
the doctrine of Election, concerning which Baillie informs us they had <span class="tei tei-q">“long
and tough debates;”</span> the other was concerning that which heads the chapter
entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Of Church Censures,”</span> as its fundamental proposition, viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Lord Jesus Christ, as King and Head of his Church, has therein appointed a
government in the hand of church-officers distinct from the civil magistrate.”</span>
This proposition the Assembly manifestly intended and understood to contain
a principle directly and necessarily opposed to the very essence of Erastianism,
and it was regarded in the same light by the Erastians themselves, hence it
had to encounter their most strenuous opposition. It was, however, somewhat
beyond the grasp of the lay-members of the Assembly, especially since their
champion Selden had in a great measure withdrawn from the debates after his
signal discomfiture by Gillespie, and consequently it was triumphantly carried,
the single dissentient voice being that of Lightfoot, the other Erastian divine,
Coleman, having died before the conclusion of the debate. The framing of the
Confession occupied the Assembly nearly a year. After having been carefully
transcribed, it was presented to the parliament on the 3d of December, 1646.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A plan similar to that already described was also employed in preparing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxviii">[pg xxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxviii" id="Pgxxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that admirable digest of Christian doctrine, the Shorter Catechism, and so far
as can be ascertained, by the same Committee. For a time, indeed, they
attempted to prosecute the framing of both Confession and Catechism at
once; but after some progress had been made with both, the Assembly resolved
to finish the Confession first, and then to construct the Catechism upon
its model, so far at least as to have no proposition in the one which was not in
the other. By this arrangement they wisely avoided the danger of subsequent
debate and delay. Various obstacles, however, interposed, and so greatly
impeded the progress of the Assembly, that the Catechism was not so speedily
completed as had been expected. It was, however, presented to the House
of Commons on the 5th of November 1647, and the Larger, in the spring of
the following year.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is one anecdote connected with the formation of the Shorter Catechism
both full of interest and so very beautiful, that it must not be omitted.
In one of the earliest meetings of the Committee, the subject of deliberation
was to frame an answer to the question <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What is God</span></span>?”</span> Each
man felt the unapproachable sublimity of the divine idea suggested by these words; but
who could venture to give it expression in human language! All shrunk from
the too sacred task in awe-struck reverential fear. At length it was resolved,
as an expression of the Committee's deep humility, that the youngest member
should first make the attempt. He consented; but begged that the brethren
would first unite with him in prayer for divine enlightenment. Then in slow
and solemn accents he thus began his prayer:—<span class="tei tei-q">“O God, Thou art a Spirit,
infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in Thy being, wisdom, power, holiness,
justice, goodness and truth.”</span>—When he ceased, the first sentence of his prayer
was immediately written down and adopted, as the most perfect answer that
could be conceived, as, indeed, in a very sacred sense, God's own answer,
descriptive of Himself.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Who, then, was the
youngest member of the Committee? When we compare the birth-dates of the respective
members of the Committee, we find that George Gillespie was the youngest by more than a
dozen years. We may, therefore, safely conclude, that George Gillespie was
the man who was thus guided to frame this marvellous answer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Without further enlarging on these points, we may, without hazard, affirm,
that however eminent Gillespie was in the department of controversy, he was
scarcely, if at all, less so in that of systematic theology, while his personal
piety was of the most elevated and spiritual character. Rarely, indeed, have
such qualities met in any one man, as were united in him; but when God
requires such a man, he creates, endows and trains him, so as to meet the
necessity.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxix">[pg xxix]</span><a name="Pgxxix" id="Pgxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the public labours of the Westminster Assembly drew near a close,
the Scottish commissioners returned to their native country. Henderson had
previously found the repose of the grave, Rutherford remained a short time
behind. Baillie and Gillespie appeared at the General Assembly which met
in August, 1647, and laid before that supreme ecclesiastical court the result
of their protracted labours. The Confession of Faith was ratified by that
Assembly. The same Assembly caused to be printed a series of propositions,
or <span class="tei tei-q">“Theses against Erastianism,”</span> as Baillie terms them, amounting to one
hundred and eleven, drawn up by George Gillespie, embodying eight of them
in the act which authorised their publication. The perusal of these propositions
would enable any person of unprejudiced and intelligent mind to master
and refute the whole Erastian theory; and could not fail, at the same time, to
draw forth sentiments of admiration towards the clear and strong mind by
which they were framed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the incessant toils in which Gillespie's life had been spent had shattered
his constitution beyond the power of recovery; and the state in which he
found Scotland on his return was such as to permit no relaxation of these
toils. The danger in which the obstinacy and duplicity of Charles I. had
placed that unhappy monarch's life, drew forth towards him the strong compassion
of all who cherished sentiments of loyalty to the sovereign and pity
for the man. But in many instances these generous feelings were allowed to
bias the dictates of religious principle and sound judgment; and a party
began to be formed for the purpose of attempting to save the King even at
the hazard of entering into a war with England. This was, of course, eagerly
encouraged by all who had previously adhered to the King's party in the contest
between him and the Covenanters; and a series of intrigues began and
were carried on, breaking the harmony which had previously existed, and
preparing for the disastrous consequences which soon afterwards ensued.
Gillespie exerted himself to the utmost of his power to avert the coming
calamities which he anticipated, by striving to prevent the commission of
crimes which provoke judgment. His influence was sufficient to restrain the
Church from consenting to countenance the weak and wicked movements of
politicians. But his health continued to sink under these incessant toils and
anxieties. He was chosen moderator of the General Assembly of 1648,
though, as Baillie states, <span class="tei tei-q">“he did much deprecate the burden, as he had great
reason, both for his health's sake, and other great causes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This Assembly met on the 12th of July, 1648, and so arduous and difficult
were the duties which it had to discharge, that it did not end its labours till
the 12th of August. Although Gillespie was then rapidly sinking under the
disease of which he died, which, from its symptoms, must have been consumption,
he continued to take an active part in all its deliberations, and drew up
the last public paper which it directed to be framed, in answer to a document,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxx">[pg xxx]</span><a name="Pgxxx" id="Pgxxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
issued by the State, respecting the engagement that had been formed for the
support of the King. The arduous labours of the Assembly being thus ended,
Gillespie left Edinburgh and retired to Kirkcaldy, with the view of seeking,
by change of scene and air, some renovation to his health. But the disease
had taken too firm a hold of his enfeebled constitution, and he continued to
suffer from increasing weakness. Still the cares of the distracted Church and
country pressed heavily on his mind. He was now unable to attend the
public meetings of Church courts; but on the 8th of September he addressed
a letter to the Commission of Assembly, in which he stated clearly and
strongly his opinion concerning the duties and the dangers of the time.
Continuing to sink, and feeling death at hand, he partly wrote and partly
dictated what may be termed his dying <span class="tei tei-q">“Testimony against association with
malignant enemies of the truth and godliness.”</span><a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> At length, on the 17th day
of December, 1648, his toils and sorrows ceased, and he fell asleep in Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So passed away from this world one of those bright and powerful spirits
which are sent in troublous times to carry forward God's work among mankind.
Incessant toil is the destiny of such highly-gifted men while here
below; and not unfrequently is their memory assailed by those mean and little
minds who shrunk with instinctive fear and hatred before the energetic
movements which they could neither comprehend nor encounter. But their
recompense is in heaven, when their work is done; and future generations
delight to rescue their reputation from the feeble obloquy with which malevolence
and folly had endeavoured to hide or defame it. Thus has it been with
George Gillespie to a considerable extent already; and we entertain not the
slightest shadow of doubt that his transcendent merit is but beginning to be
known and appreciated as it deserves, and that ere very long his well-earned
fame will shine too clearly and too strong to be approached by detractors.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have but little more to relate respecting George Gillespie. His death
was deeply lamented by all who loved their church and country at the time;
and such was the feeling generally entertained of his great merit, that the
Committee of Estates, or government of the kingdom, by an Act dated 20th
December, 1648, did, <span class="tei tei-q">“as an acknowledgment for his faithfulness in all the
public employments entrusted to him by this Church, both at home and
abroad, his faithful labours, and indefatigable diligence in all the exercises of
his ministerial calling, for his Master's service, and his learned writings, published
to the world, in which rare and profitable employments, both for Church
and State, he truly spent himself and closed his days, ordain, That the sum of
one thousand pounds sterling be given to his widow and children.”</span> And
though the Parliament did, by their Act, dated June 8th, 1650, unanimously
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxi">[pg xxxi]</span><a name="Pgxxxi" id="Pgxxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ratify the preceding Act, and recommended to their Committee to make the
same effectual, yet in consequence of Cromwell's invasion, and the confusion
into which the whole kingdom was thereby thrown, this benevolent design
was frustrated, as his grandson, the Rev. George Gillespie, minister at Strathmiglo,
afterwards declared.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
So much for the trust to be placed in national
gratitude and the promises of statesmen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
George Gillespie was buried at Kirkcaldy, his birth-place, and the place
also where he died. A tomb-stone, erected to his memory by his relatives and
friends, bore an inscription in Latin, recording the chief actions of his life, and
stating the leading elements of his character. But when Prelacy was re-imposed
on Scotland, after the restoration of Charles II., the mean malice of the
Prelatists gratified itself by breaking the tomb-stone. This petty and spiteful
act is thus recorded in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mercurius Caledonius,”</span> one of the small quarto
newspapers or periodicals of the time, of date January 16th to 25th, 1661.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The late Committee of Estates ordered the tomb-stone of Mr George Gillespie,
whereon was engraven a scandalous inscription, should be fetched from
the burial place, and upon a market-day, at the cross of Kirkcaldy, where he
had formerly been minister, and there solemnly broken by the hands of the
hangman; which was accordingly done,—a just indignity upon the memory of
so dangerous a person.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Committee of Estates by which this paltry deed was done was that of
Middleton's parliament, frequently called the <span class="tei tei-q">“drunken parliament,”</span> from the
excesses of its leading men, and which on the following year signalised itself by
the Glasgow act,—that act which emptied nearly four hundred pulpits in one
day. The inaccuracy of the statement made by the prelatic newspaper, asserting
that he had formerly been minister at Kirkcaldy, will not surprise any
person who is acquainted with the writings of the Prelatists of that period,
who seem not to have been able to write the truth when relating the most common
and well-known facts. But one is somewhat surprised to find statements
equally inaccurate made respecting George Gillespie, by reverend and learned
historians. In Dr Cook's History of the Church of Scotland, we find in one passage
George Gillespie's character and conduct completely misunderstood and
misrepresented, (vol. iii. pages 160-162), and in a subsequent passage an assertion
that the proceedings of that party in the church called the Protestors
were, in the year 1650, <span class="tei tei-q">“directed by Gillespie, a factious minister, whose name
has been frequently mentioned,”</span> (page 196). George Gillespie was the only person
of whom mention was made, or could be made, in the previous portion of the
history, as his brother had not then began to take any active part in public
affairs; but he was dead nearly two years before the date to which the latter
passage refers. It is plain that Dr Cook confounded George Gillespie with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxii">[pg xxxii]</span><a name="Pgxxxii" id="Pgxxxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his brother Patrick, and ascribed to the former the actions of the latter, regarding
them both as but one and the same person. He further asserts, that
Gillespie was <span class="tei tei-q">“suspected of corresponding with the Sectaries.”</span> That Patrick
Gillespie corresponded with the Sectaries, and was much trusted and countenanced
by Cromwell, is perfectly true; but before that time George Gillespie
had joined the One Church and family in heaven. In every period of his life,
and in every transaction in which he was engaged, George Gillespie was far
above all private or discreditable intriguing, which is the vice of weak, cunning,
and selfish minds. And while we do not think it necessary further to
prosecute this vindication of his memory, we yet think it our duty, when writing
a memoir of him, thus briefly to set aside the groundless accusation,
whether it be adduced by prelatic or Erastian writers,—his baffled antagonists
when living, his impotent calumniators when dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The tomb-stone, as has been related, was broken in 1661, but the inscription
was preserved. A plain tablet was erected in 1745, by his grandson, the
Rev. George Gillespie, minister of Strathmiglo, on which the inscription was
re-produced, with a slight addition, mentioning both events. It is still to be
seen in the south-east porch of the present church. The inscription is
as follows:—

in peace on the same day on which the League of the three kingdoms was

Such was the <span class="tei tei-q">“scandalous inscription”</span> which the peevish spleen, yet bitter
malice of Scottish Prelacy, found gratification in attempting to destroy. But
there is a righteous retribution even in this world. Men rear their own monuments,
and write inscriptions on them which time cannot obliterate. Gillespie's
enduring monument is in his actions and his writings, which latest ages will
admire. The monuments of Scottish Prelacy are equally imperishable, whether
in the wantonly defaced tomb-stones of piety and patriotism, or in the moss-grown
martyr-stones that stud the moors and glens of our native land; and
the inscriptions thereupon are fearfully legible with records of indelible
infamy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remains but to offer a few remarks respecting Gillespie's various works.
The first production of his pen was his remarkable <span class="tei tei-q">“Dispute against the
English Popish Ceremonies.”</span> It was published in 1637, when its author was
only in the 25th year of his age; and it must have been completed some time
previous to its publication, as it appears to have been printed abroad, most
probably in Holland. This gives countenance to one statement which affirms
it to have been written when Gillespie had scarcely passed his 22d year.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His next work was published in London, in the year 1641, where he was
during the progress of the treaty with the King. It is referred to by Baillie
in the following terms:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Think not we live any of us here to be idle;
Mr Henderson has ready now a short treatise, much called for, of our church
discipline; Mr Gillespie has the grounds of Presbyterial Government well
Asserted; Mr Blair, a pertinent answer to Hall's Remonstrance: all these are
ready for the press.”</span> The valuable treatise here referred to has not been so
much noticed as several other of Gillespie's writings, but is included in this
collective edition.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxiv">[pg xxxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxxiv" id="Pgxxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His Sermons and Controversial Pamphlets were produced in the years
1641-5-6, during the sittings of the Westminster Assembly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Aaron's Rod Blossoming was published at London also, about the close of
the year 1646. This is his greatest work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The celebrated Hundred and Eleven Propositions were prepared before he
left London, and laid before the General Assembly on his return to Scotland
in the summer of 1647. Perhaps it is not possible to obtain a clear conception
of Erastianism better than by the study of these propositions. They have
been reprinted several times, yet were rarely to be obtained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The short, yet very able and high-principled papers which he prepared for
the Assembly and its Commission in 1648, were his latest writings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A short time after his death, and during the year 1649, his brother Patrick
published in one volume, entitled a <span class="tei tei-q">“Treatise of Miscellany Questions,”</span> a
series of papers, twenty-two in number, on a variety of important topics,
which appeared to be in a condition fit for the press. Though this is a
posthumous production, and consequently without its author's finishing
corrections, it displays the same clearness, precision, and logical power, which
characterise his other works. We are inclined to conjecture that these
Essays, as we would now term them, were written at different times during
the course of several years, and while he was studying the various topics to
which they relate. Several of them are on subjects which were debated in
the Westminster Assembly; and it is very probable that Gillespie wrote them
while maturing his views on these points preparatory for those discussions in
which he so greatly distinguished himself. This conjecture is strengthened
by the curious and interesting fact, that a paper, which will be found
beginning at page 109 of the part now printed for the first time from
the MS., is almost identical, both in argument and language, though
somewhat different in arrangement, with chapter viii. pages 115 to 120, of
Aaron's Rod. The arrangement in the Aaron's Rod is more succinct than in
the paper referred to, but its principles, and very much of the language, are
altogether the same. May not this indicate Gillespie's mode of study and
composition? May he not have been in the habit of concentrating his mind
on the leading topics of the subjects which he was studying, writing out pretty
fully and carefully his thoughts on these topics, and afterwards connecting and
arranging them so as to form one complete work? If so, then we may conclude
that the Miscellany Questions contain such of these masses of separate
thinking as Gillespie found no opportunity of using in any other manner, and,
therefore, consented to their publication in their present form.

In Wodrow's Analecta it is stated that Gillespie had a manuscript volume
of sermons prepared for the press, which were bought from the printer by the
Sectaries, and probably destroyed. It is also stated, that there were six
octavo volumes of notes written by Gillespie at the Westminster Assembly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxv">[pg xxxv]</span><a name="Pgxxxv" id="Pgxxxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then extant, containing an abstract of its deliberations. Of these manuscript
volumes there are two copies in the Wodrow MSS., Advocates' Library, but
neither of them appears to be Gillespie's own hand-writing; the quarto certainly
is not, and the octavo seems to be an accurate copy of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> of the
original volumes. These have been collated and transcribed by Mr Meek,
with his well-known care and fidelity, and the result is now, for the first
time, given to the public. What has become of the missing volumes is
not known, and it is to be feared the loss is irrecoverable. There is one
consideration, however, which mitigates our regret for the loss of these
volumes. The one which has been preserved begins February 2d, 1644, and
ends January 3d, 1645.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
Lightfoot's Journal continues till the end of 1644,
and then terminates abruptly, as if he had not felt it necessary any longer to
continue noting down the outline of the debates. Yet Lightfoot continued to
attend the Assembly throughout the whole of its protracted deliberations.
From other sources also, we learn that the whole of the points on which there
existed any considerable difference of opinion in the Assembly, had been
largely debated during the year 1644, so that little remained to be said on
either side. The differences, indeed, continued; but they assumed the form
of written controversy, the essence of which we have in the volume entitled,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Grand Debate.”</span> It is probable, therefore, that the lost volumes of
Gillespie's manuscript contained chiefly his own remarks on the writings of
the Independents, and, not unlikely, the outlines of the answers returned by
the Assembly. Supposing this to be the case, it would doubtless have been
very interesting to have had Gillespie's remarks and arguments, but they
could not have given much information which we do not at present possess.

considerable importance, as giving us a specimen of the manner in which the
Grand Committee acted. The Grand Committee was composed of some of the
most influential persons of the Lords, of the Commons, and of the Assembly,
together with the Scottish Commissioners. The duty of that Committee was
to consult together respecting the subjects to be brought before the Assembly,
and to prepare a formal statement of those subjects for the purpose of regular
deliberation. By this process a large amount of debate was precluded, and
the leading men were enabled to understand each other's sentiments before the
more public discussions began. And as the Scottish Commissioners were
necessarily constituent members of this Committee, their influence in directing
the whole proceedings was both very great, and in constant operation.
Lightfoot's journal gives no account of the proceedings of this Committee.

It has been already stated that there are two MS. volumes, purporting to
be copies of Gillespie's Notes. The one of these is in octavo, and seems to
have been carefully taken; the other is in quarto, and appears to be partly a
copy, partly an abstract. In it Gillespie is always spoken of in the third
person, which has caused many variations. The transcriber has also made
many omissions, not only of one, but of several paragraphs at a time, frequently
passing over the remarks of the several speakers. It appears to
have been his object to copy chiefly the argumentative part of the manuscript.
This defective transcription had belonged to Mr William Veitch, as appears
from his name written on the cover and first page, with the addition
<span class="tei tei-q">“minister at Peebles, 1691.”</span> In the copy transcribed for the press, the octavo
manuscript has been followed. The quarto, however, along with Lightfoot,
has been found useful in correcting the Scripture references, which had all to
be carefully examined and verified; but sometimes all three failed to give satisfaction,
and a conjectural substitute has been given, enclosed in brackets, and
with a point of interrogation. In concluding these remarks, we cannot help
expressing great gratification to see for the first time a complete edition of the
works of George Gillespie; and in order also to complete the memoir, we add,
as an appendix, some very interesting extracts from the Maitland Club edition
of Wodrow's Analecta, chiefly relative to his last illness and death.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“MR GEORGE GILLESPIE.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mr George Gillespie, first minister of Kirkcaldy, and afterward minister of
Edinburgh; when he was a child, he seemed to be somewhat dull and soft like, so that his
mother would have stricken and abused him, and she would have made much of Patrick, his
younger brother. His father, Mr John Gillespie, minister of Kirkcaldy, was angry to see
his wife carry so to his son George; and he would have said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘My heart, let alone;
though Patrick may have some respect given him in the Church, yet my son George will be
the great man in the Church of Scotland.’</span> And he said of him when he was a-dying,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘George, George, I have gotten many a brave promise for thee.’</span> And indeed he was
very soon a great man; for it's reported, that before he was a preacher, he wrote the
<span class="tei tei-q">‘English Popish Ceremonies.’</span> He was, of all ministers in his time, one of the
greatest men for disputing and arguing; so that he was, being but a young man, much
admired at the Assembly at Westminster, by
all that heard him; he being one of the youngest members that was there. I heard old Mr
Patrick Simson say, that he heard his cousin, Mr George Gillespie say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let no man who
is called of God to any work, be it never so great and difficult, distrust God for
assistance, as I clearly found at that great Assembly at Westminster. If I were to live a
long time in the world, I would not desire a more noble life, than the life of pure and
single dependence on God; for, said he, though I may have a claim to some gifts of
learning and parts, yet I ever found more advantage by single looking to God for
assistance than by all the parts and gifts that ever I could pretend to, at that
time.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When he was at London, he would be often on his knees; at another time,
reading and writing. And when he was sitting in that great Assembly at Westminster, he
was often observed to have a little book, and to be marking down something with his pen
in that book, even when some of the most learned men, as Coleman and Selden, were
delivering their long and learned orations, and all he was writing was for the most part
his pithy ejaculations to God, writing these words; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Da lucem, Domine;
Da lucem!</span></span> When these learned men had ended their oration, the Moderator proposed who
should give an answer to their discourse; they all generally voted Mr Gillespie to be the
person. He being a young man, seemed to blush, and desired to be excused, when so many
old and learned divines were present, yet all the brethren, with one voice, determined he
should be the person that should give an answer to that learned oration. Though he seemed
to take little heed, yet being thus pressed, he rose up, and resumed all the particulars
of that learned oration very distinctly, and answered every part of it so fully, that all
that heard him were amazed and astonished; for he died in 1648, and was then but about
thirty-six years of age. Mr Calamy, if I be not forgotten, said, we were ready to think
more of Mr Gillespie than was truly meet; if he had not been stained by being against our
way and judgment for the Engagement.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He was one of the great men that had a chief hand in penning our most
excellent Confession of Faith and Catechisms. He was a most grave and bold man, and had a
most wonderful gift given him for disputing and arguing. My father told me, he observed
that when there was a considerable number of ministers met, there were several of our
great nobles were strongly reasoning with our ministers about the engagement 1648. When
Mr Gillespie was busy studying his sermon that he was to preach before the Parliament
to-morrow, the ministers sent privately for Mr Gillespie, whom he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxviii">[pg xxxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxxviii" id="Pgxxxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
observed to come in very quietly, and when Lauderdale, Glencairn, and some others, rose
up and debated very strongly for the engagement, Mr Gillespie rose up and answered them
so fully and distinctly, firstly, secondly, and thirdly, that he fully silenced them all;
and Glencairn said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘There is no standing before this great and mighty man!’</span> I heard
worthy Mr Rowat say, that Mr Gillespie said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The more truly great a man is, he was
really the more humble and low in his own eyes,’</span> as he instanced in the great man
Daniel; and, said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘God did not make choice of some of us as his instruments in the
glorious work of Reformation, because we were more fit than others, but rather because we
were more unfit than others.’</span> He was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malleus
Mallignantium</span></span>, and Mr Baillie, writing to some in this church anent Mr George
Gillespie, said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘He was truly an ornament to our church and nation.’</span> And Mr James
Brown, late minister of Glasgow, told me that there was an English gentleman said to him,
that he heard Mr Gillespie preach, and he said, he believed he was one of the greatest
Presbyterians in the world. He was taken from the Greyfriars' Church to the New Church.
He has written several pieces, as <span class="tei tei-q">‘Aaron's Rod
Blossoming,’</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‘Some Miscellany Questions,’</span> and his <span class="tei tei-q">‘Assertion of the
Government of the Church of Scotland, about Ruling Elders.’</span> He had several little
books wherein he set down his remarks upon the proceedings of the Assembly at
Westminster.”</span>—WODROW'S ANALECTA, vol. iii. pp. 109-18.

memory was most exact. What concerns Mr Gillespie, and the Marquis of Montrose, I read

(ACCOUNT OF THE LAST ILLNESS AND DEATH OF MR GEORGE GILLESPIE.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mr George Gillespie being moderator of the Assembly held at Edinburgh, July
12th, 1648, was all the time thereof, as also half a year before, in a greater weakness
of body than ordinary; that being now come to a height, which long before had been
gathering. He had a great hoasting and sweating, which in the time of the General
Assembly began to grow worse; but being extraordinarily (so I may say) upheld, was not so
sensible as when the Assembly dissolved it appeared to be. On occasion whereof, the next
Wednesday after the rising of the Assembly, he went with his wife over to Kirkcaldy,
there intending to tarry for a space, till it should please the Lord, by the use of
means, to restore him to some more health to come over again. But when he was come there,
his weakness and disease grew daily more and more, so that no application of any strength
durst be used towards him. It came to that, he kept his chamber still to his death,
wearing and wasting hoasting, and sweating. Ten days before his death his sweating went
away, and his hoasting lessened, yet his weakness still encreased, and his flux still
continued. On Wednesday morning, which day he began to keep his bed, his pain began to be
very violent, his breath more obstructed, his heart oppressed; and that growing all the
next night to a very great height, in the midst of the night there were letters written
to his brother, and Mr Rutherford, and Mr John Row, his
death approaching fast. On Friday all day, and Thursday all night, he was at some ease.
Friday at night, till Saturday in the afternoon, in great violence, the greatness of pain
causing want of sleep. Mr Rutherford and Lord Craigihall came to visit him. Thus much for
his body. Now I'll speak a little of what concerns his soul, and the exercise
of his mind all the while.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Monday, December 11, 1648, came my Lords Argyle, Cassils, Elcho, and Warriston to visit
him. He did faithfully declare his mind to them, as public men, in that point whereof he
hath left a testimony to the view of the world, as afterwards; and the speaking was very
burdensome, yet he spared not very freely to fasten their duty upon them. The exercise
of his mind all the time of his sickness was vary sad and constant, without comfortable
manifestations, and sensible presence for the time, yet he continued in a constant faith
of adherence, which ended in an adhering assurance, his grips growing still the stronger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One day, a fortnight before his death, he had leaned down on a little bed,
and taking a fit of faintness, and his mind being heavily exercised, and lifting up his
eyes, this expression fell with great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxix">[pg xxxix]</span><a name="Pgxxxix" id="Pgxxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
weight from his mouth, <span class="tei tei-q">‘O my dear Lord, forsake me not forever!’</span> His weariness of
this life was very great, and his longing to be relieved, and to be where the veil would
be taken away.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tuesday, December 14, (1648) he was in heavy sickness, and three pastors
came in the afternoon to visit him, of whom one said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Lord hath made you
faithful in all he hath employed you in, and it's likely we be put to the trial;
therefore what encouragement give you us thereanent!’</span> Whereto he answered in few
words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have gotten more by the Lord's immediate assistance than ever I had by
study, in the disputes I had in the Assembly of Divines in England; therefore let never
man distrust God for assistance that cast themselves on him, and follow his calling. For
my own part, the time that I have had in the exercise of the ministry is but a
moment.’</span> To which sentence another pastor answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘But your moment hath exceeded
the gray heads of others! This I may speak without flattery.’</span> To which he answered
disclaiming it with a <span class="tei tei-q">‘no;’</span> for he desired still to have Christ exalted, as he said
at the same time, and another. And at other times, when any such things were spoken to
him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘What are all my righteousnesses but rotten rags? All that I have done cannot
abide the touchstone of his justice. They are all but abominations, and as an unclean
thing, when they are reckoned between my God and me. Christ is all things, and I am
nothing!’</span> The other pastor when the rest were out, asked, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Whether he was enjoying
the comforts of God's presence, or if they were for a time suspended! He answered,
Indeed they were suspended.’</span> Then within a little while he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Comforts! aye
comforts!’</span> meaning, that they were not easily attained. His wife said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘What
reck'd the comfort if believing is not suspended!’</span> He said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘No.’</span> Speaking
farther to that his condition, he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Although that I should never see any more
light of comfort than I do see, yet I shall adhere, and do believe that He is mine, and
I am his!’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The next morrow being Friday, he not being able to write, did dictate out
the rest of a paper, which he had been before writing himself, and did subscribe it
before two witnesses, who also did subscribe; wherein he gave faithful and clear
testimony to the work and cause of God, and against the enemies thereof, to stop the
mouths of calumniators and to confirm his children.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In all his discourses this was mixed as one thing, that he longed for the
time of relief, and rejoiced because it was so near. His breath being very short, he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Where the hallelujahs are sung to the Lamb, there is no shortness of breath!’</span>
And being in very great pain all the Friday night, his mother said in the morning, <span class="tei tei-q">‘In
all appearance you will not have another night.’</span> To which he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Think you that
your word will hold good?’</span> She said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I fear it will hold over good.’</span> He said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Not over good.’</span> That day he blessed his children and some others, (Mr Patrick
Simson, the writer of this) and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘God bless you: and as you carry the name of your
grandfather, so God grant you his graces.’</span> That afternoon, being Saturday, came Mr
Samuel Rutherford, who, among other things, said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The day, I hope, is dawning, and
breaking in your soul, that shall never, have an end.’</span> He said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is not broken
yet; but though I walk in darkness and see no light, yet I will trust in the name of the
Lord and stay upon my God!’</span> Mr Samuel said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Would not Christ be a welcome guest to
you?’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Welcome! the welcomest guest that ever I saw.’</span> He said
further, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Doth not your soul love Christ above all things?’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I love
him heartily: who ever knew any thing of him but would love him!’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mr James Wilson going to pray, asked <span class="tei tei-q">‘What petitions he would have him to
put up for him?’</span> He said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘For more of himself, and strength to carry me through the
dark valley.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Saturday night he became weaker, and inclined to drowsiness and sleeping,
and was discerned in his drowsiness a little to rave; yet being till the last half hour
in his full and perfect senses, and having taken a little jelly and drink, about half an
hour before his death he spake as sensibly betwixt as ever, and blessed some persons that
morning with very spiritual and heavenly expressions. About seven or eight of the clock
his drowsiness encreased, and he was overheard in it speaking (after he had spoken more
imperfectly some words before) those words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Glory! Glory! a seeing of God! a seeing of
God! I hope it shall be for his glory!’</span> After he had taken a little refreshment of
jelly, and a little drink through a reed, he said that the giving him these things made
him drowsy; and a little afterwards, <span class="tei tei-q">‘There is a great drowsiness on me, I know not how
it comes.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“His wife seeing the time draw near, spake to him and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The time of
your relief is now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexl">[pg xl]</span><a name="Pgxl" id="Pgxl" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
near, and hard at hand.’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I long for that time. O! happy they that are
there.’</span> This was the last word he was heard sensibly to speak. Mr Frederick Carmichael
being there, they went to prayer, expecting death so suddenly. In the midst of prayer he
left his rattling<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> and the pangs and fetches of death begin thence, his senses went away.
Whereupon they rose from prayer, and beheld till, in a very gentle manner, the pins of
his tabernacle were loosed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He said (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supra</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-q">‘Say not over good,’</span> because he
thought she wronged him so far in wishing the contrary of what he longed for.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mr Carmichael said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘You have been very faithful, and the Lord has honoured you to
do him very much service, and now you are to get your reward.’</span> He answered <span class="tei tei-q">‘I think
it reward enough, that ever I got leave to do him any service in truth and
sincerity.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This account was dictated to me by Mr Patrick Simson, Mr Gillespie's cousin, who was with
him to his last sickness, and at his death, and took minutes at the time of these his
expressions. I read it over, after I had written it, to him. He corrected some words, and
said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is all I mind about his expressions toward his close. They made some
impression on me at the time, and I then set them down. I have not read the paper that I
mind these forty years, but I am pretty positive these were his very words.”</span> A day or
two after, I went in with him to his closet to look for another paper, for now he had
almost lost his sight, and in a bundle, I fell on the paper he wrote at the time, and
told him of it. When we compared it with what I wrote, there was not the least variation
betwixt the original and what I wrote, save an inconsiderable word or two, here altered;
which is an instance of a strong memory, the greatest ever I knew.

<span class="tei tei-q">“George Gillespie was born January 21st, 1613. He was first minister at
Weemyse, the first admitted under Presbytery 1638. He was minister at Weemyse about two
years. He was very young when laureate, before he was seventeen. He was chaplain first
to my lord Kenmure, then to the Lord of Cassilis. When he was with Cassilis, he wrote
his <span class="tei tei-q">‘English Popish Ceremonies,’</span> which when printed, he was about twenty-two. He
wrote a <span class="tei tei-q">‘Dialogue between a Civilian and Divine,’</span> a piece against Toleration,
entitled <span class="tei tei-q">‘Wholesome Severity reconciled with Christian Liberty.’</span> He died in strong

darkness as to assurance, which faith of adherence he preached much. He died December
seventeen, 1648. If he had lived to January 21, 1649, he had been thirty six years.</span>

full ten years in the ministry. He had all his sermons in England, part polemical, part
practical prepared for the press, and but one copy of them, which he told the printer's
wife he used to deal with, and bade her have a care of them. And she was prevailed on by
some money from the Sectaries, who were mauled by him, to suppress them. He was very
clear in all his notions, and the manner

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As Satan's malice, and man's wickedness, cease
not to molest the thrice happy estate of the church
of Christ, so hath the eternal council of the only
wise God predetermined the coming of offences,
persecutions, heresies, schisms and divisions, that
professors may be proved before they be as approved
and made manifest, 1 Cor. xi. 19. And
hence <span class="tei tei-q">“It must needs be that offences come,”</span> Matt.
xviii. 17; neither hath the church ever enjoyed both
purity and peace any long time together. But whiles
the church of God, thus disquieted, at well with dangerous
alterations, as with doleful altercations, is
presented in the theatre of this world, and crieth
out to beholders, <span class="tei tei-q">“Have ye no regard, all ye that
pass by!”</span> Lam. i. 12. A pity it is to see the crooked
and sinistrous courses of the greatest part, every
man moving his period within the enormous confines
of his own exorbitant desires; the atheistical
nullisidian, nothing regardeth the assoiling of ecclesiastical
controversies,—he is of Gallio's humour,
Acts xviii. 17, and cares for none of those things;
the sensual Epicurean and riotous ruffian (go
church matters as they will) eats and drinks, and
takes his pleasure; the cynical critic spueth out
bitter aspersions, gibeth and justleth at everything
that can be said or done in the cause of religion;
the acenical jester playeth fast and loose, and can
utter anything in sport, but nothing in earnest; the
avaricious worldling hath no tune but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Give</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">give</span></em>,
and no anthem pleaseth him but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Have</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em>; the
aspiring Diotrephes puffeth down every course
which cannot puff up; the lofty favourite taketh
the pattern of his religion from the court iconography,
and if the court swim, he cares not though
the church sink; the subdulous Machiavillian accounteth
the show of religion profitable, but the
substance of it troublesome: he studieth not the
oracles of God but the principles of Satanical
guile, which be learneth so well that he may go to
the devil to be bishopped; the turn-coat temporiser
wags with every wind, and (like Diogenes turning
about the mouth of his voluble hogshead, after the
course of the sun) wheresoever the bright beams of
coruscant authority do shine and cherish, thither
followeth and sitteth he; the gnathonic parasite
sweareth to all that his benefactor holdeth; the
mercenary pensioner will bow before he break; he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-iv">[pg 1-iv]</span><a name="Pg1-iv" id="Pg1-iv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who only studieth to have the praise of some witty
invention, cannot strike upon another anvil; the
silly idiot (with Absolom's two hundred, 2 Sam. xv.
11,) goeth, in the simplicity of his heart, after his
perverse leaders; the lapped Nicodemite holds it
enough to yield some secret assent to the truth,
though neither his profession nor his practice testify
so much; he whose mind is possessed with prejudicate
opinions against the truth, when convincing
light is holden forth to him, looketh asquint,
and therefore goeth awry; the pragmatical adiaphorist,
with his span-broad faith and ell-broad conscience,
doth no small harm—the poor pandect of
his plagiary profession in matters of faith reckoneth
little for all, and in matters of practice all for
little. Shortly, if an expurgatory index were compiled
of those, and all other sorts of men, who either
through their careless and neutral on looking, make
no help to the troubled and disquieted church of
Christ, or through their nocent accession and overthwart
intermeddling, work out her greater harm,
alas! how few feeling members were there to be
found behind who truly lay to heart her estate and
condition? Nevertheless, in the worst times, either
of raging persecution or prevailing defection, as God
Almighty hath ever hitherto, so both now, and to
the end, he will reserve to himself a remnant according
to the election of grace, who cleave to his
blessed truth and to the purity of his holy worship,
and are grieved for the affliction of Joseph, as being
themselves also in the body, in confidence whereof
I take boldness to stir you up at this time, by putting
you in remembrance. If you would be rightly
informed of the present estate of the reformed
churches, you must not acquiesce in the pargetting
verdict of those who are wealthy and well at ease,
and mounted aloft upon the uncogged wheels of
prosperous fortune (as they call it). Those whom
the love of the world hath not enhanced to the serving
of the time can give you the soundest judgment.
It is noted of Dionysius Hallicarnasseus<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> (who was
never advanced to magistracy in the Roman republic)
that he hath written far more truly of the Romans
than Fabius, Salustius, or Cato, who flourished
among them with riches and honours.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-v">[pg 1-v]</span><a name="Pg1-v" id="Pg1-v" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After that it pleased God, by the light of his glorious
gospel, to dispel the more than cimmerian
darkness of antichristianism, and, by the antidote of
reformation, to avoid the poison of Popery; forasmuch
as in England and Ireland, every noisome
weed which God's hand had never planted was not
pulled up, therefore we now see the faces of those
churches overgrown with the repullulating twigs
and sprigs of popish superstition. Mr Sprint acknowledgeth
the Reformation of England to have
been defective, and saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is easy to imagine of
what difficulty it was to reform all things at the
first, where the most part of the privy council, of
the nobility, bishops, judges, gentry, and people,
were open or close Papists, where few or none of
any countenance stood for religion at the first, but
the Protector and Cranmer.”</span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>
The church of Scotland
was blessed with a more glorious and perfect
reformation than any of our neighbour churches.
The doctrine, discipline, regiment, and policy established
here by ecclesiastical and civil laws, and
sworn and subscribed unto by the king's majesty
and several presbyteries and parish churches of the
land, as it had the applause of foreign divines; so
was it in all points agreeable unto the word, neither
could the most rigid Aristarchus of these times
challenge any irregularity of the same. But now,
alas! even this church, which was once so great a
praise in the earth is deeply corrupted, and hath
<span class="tei tei-q">“turned aside quickly out of the way,”</span> Exod. xxxii.
8. So that this is the Lord's controversy against
Scotland. <span class="tei tei-q">“I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly
a right seed? How then art thou turned into the
degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?”</span> Jer.
ii. 21.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not this day feared, but felt, that the rotten
dregs of Popery, which were never purged away
from England and Ireland and having once been
spued out with detestation, are licked up again in
Scotland, prove to be the unhappy occasions of a
woeful recidivation. Neither is there need of Lyncean
eyes, for if we be not poreblind, it cannot be
hid from us. What doleful and disastrous mutation
(to be bewailed with tears of blood) hath happened
to the church and spouse of Christ in these
dominions? Her comely countenance is miscoloured
with the fading lustre of the mother of harlots,
her shamefaced forehead hath received the mark of
the beast, her lovely locks are frizled with the
crisping pins of antichristian fashions, her chaste
ears are made to listen to the friends of the great
whore, who bring the bewitching doctrine of enchanting
traditions, her dove eyes look pleasantly
upon the well attired harlot, her sweet voice is
mumming and muttering some missal and magical
liturgies, her fair neck beareth the halter like to
kens of her former captivity, even a burdensome
chain of superfluous and superstitious ceremonies,
her undefiled garments are stained with the meritricious
bravery of Babylonish ornaments, and with
the symbolising badges of conformity with Rome,
her harmless hands reach brick and mortar to the
building of Babel, her beautiful feet with shoes are
all besmeared, whilst they return apace in the way
of Egypt, and wade the ingruent brooks of Popery.
Oh! transformed virgin, whether is thy beauty gone
from thee? Oh! forlorn prince's daughter, how
art thou not ashamed to look thy Lord in the face?
Oh! thou best beloved among women, what hast
thou to do with the inveigling appurtenances and
habilement of Babylon the whore?—But among
such things as have been the accursed means of
the church's desolation, which peradventure might
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-vi">[pg 1-vi]</span><a name="Pg1-vi" id="Pg1-vi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seem to some of you to have least harm or evil in
them, are the ceremonies of kneeling in the act of
receiving the Lord's supper, cross in baptism, bishopping,
holidays, &amp;c., which are pressed under the
name of things indifferent; yet if you survey the
sundry inconveniences and grievous consequences
of the same, you will think far otherwise. The vain
shows and shadows of these ceremonies have hid
and obscured the substance of religion; the true
life of godliness is smothered down and suppressed
by the burden of these human inventions, for their
sakes, many, who are both faithful servants to
Christ and loyal subjects to the king, are evil spoken
of, mocked, reproached, menanced, molested;
for their sakes Christian brethren are offended, and
the weak are greatly scandalised; for their sakes the
most powerful and painful ministers in the land are
either thrust out, or threatened to be thrust out from
their callings; for their sakes the best qualified and
most hopeful expectants are debarred from entering
into the ministry; for their sakes the seminaries of
learning are so corrupted, that few or no good plants
can come forth from thence, for their sakes many
are admitted into the sacred ministry, who are either
popish and Arminianised, who minister to the flock
poison instead of food; or silly ignorants, who can
dispense no wholesome food to the hungry; or else
vicious in their lives, who draw many with them into
the dangerous precipice of soul perdition; or, lastly,
so earthly minded, that they favour only the
things of this earth, not the things of the Spirit of
God, who feed themselves, but not the flock, and to
whom the Great Shepherd of the sheep wilt say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither
have ye healed that which was sick, neither have
ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye
brought again that which was driven away, neither
have ye sought that which was lost,”</span> Ezek. xxxiv. 4.
Simple ones, who have some taste and relish of popish
superstition (for many such there be in the
land), do suck from the intoxicated drugs of conformity,
the softer milk which makes them grow in
error. And who can be ignorant what a large spread
Popery, Arminianism and reconciliation with Rome,
have taken among the arch urgers of the ceremonies?
What marvel that Papists clap their hands!
for they see the day coming which they wish for.
Woe to thee, O land, which bears professed Papists
and avouched Atheists, but cannot bear them who
desire to <span class="tei tei-q">“abstain from all appearance of evil,”</span> 1
Thes. v. 22, for truth and equity are fallen in thee,
and <span class="tei tei-q">“he that departeth from evil maketh himself a
prey,”</span> Isa. lix. 14, 15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are the best wares which the big hulk of
conformity, favoured with the prosperous gale of
mighty authority, hath imported amongst us, and
whilst our opposites so quiverly go about to spread
the bad wares of these encumbering inconveniences,
is it time for as luskishly to sit still and to be silent?
<span class="tei tei-q">“Woe unto us, for the day goeth away, for the
shadows of the evening are stretched out,”</span> Jer.
vi. 4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, besides the prevailing inconveniency
of the controverted ceremonies, the unlawfulness of
them is also plainly evinced in this ensuing dispute
by such convincing arguments, as, being duly pondered
in the equal balance of an attentive mind,
shall, by God's grace, afford satisfaction to so many
as purpose to buy the truth, and not to sell it.
Wherefore, referring to the dispute the points
themselves which are questioned, I am in this place
to beseech you all by the mercies of God, that, remembering
the words of the Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“Them that
honour me I will honour, and they that despise me
shalt be lightly esteemed,”</span> 1 Sam. ii. 30, remembering,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-vii">[pg 1-vii]</span><a name="Pg1-vii" id="Pg1-vii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also, the curse and condemnation of Meroz,
which came not to help the Lord against the
mighty, Judg. v. 23, of the nobles of Tekoa, who
put not their necks to the work of the Lord, Neh.
iii. 5 and, shortly, of all such as have no courage
for the truth, Jer. ix. 3, but seek their own things,
not the things which are Jesus Christ's, Phil. ii. 21,
and, finally, taking to heart how the Lord Jesus,
when he cometh in the glory of his Father with his
holy angels, Mark viii. 38, will be ashamed of every
one who hath been ashamed of him and his words
in the midst of a sinful and crooked generation,
you would, with a holy zeal and invincible courage,
against all contrary error, superstition, and
abuse whatsoever, set yourselves both to speak and
do, and likewise (having a calling) to suffer for the
truth of Christ and for the purity of his worship,
being in nothing terrified by your adversaries, Phil.
i. 28, 1 Pet. iii. 14, which, that ye may the better
perform, I commend to your thoughts these wholesome
admonitions which follow—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. When you see so much diversity both of
opinion and practice in things pertaining to religion,
the rather ye ought to give all diligence for
trying the things which are different, Phil. i. 10. If
you judge us before you hear us, then do you contrary
to the very law of nature and nations, John
vii. 51, Acts v. 16. Neither will it help you at your
reckoning to say, We believed our spiritual guides,
our prelates and preachers, whom God had set over
us. Nay, what if your guides be blind? then they
not only fall in the ditch themselves, but you with
them, Matth. iv. 14. Our Master would not have
the Jews to rest upon the testimony of John Baptist
himself, but would have them to search the Scriptures,
John v. 33, 34, 39, by which touch stone the
Bereans tried the Apostle's own doctrine, and are
commended for so doing, Acts xvii. 11. But as we
wish you not to condemn our cause without examining
the same by the Word, so neither do we desire
you blindly to follow us in adhering unto it, for
what if your seeing guides be taken from you?
How, then, shall you see to keep out of the ditch?
We would neither have you to fight for us nor
against us, like the blind sword players, Andabatæ,
a people who were said to fight with their eyes
closed. Consider, therefore, what we say, and the
Lord give you understanding in all things, 2 Tim.
ii. 7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. Since the God of heaven is the greatest king,
who is to rule and reign over you by his Word,
which he hath published to the world, and, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tunc vere</span></span>,
&amp;c., then is God truly said to reign in us when no
worldly thing is harboured and haunted in our souls, saith
Theophylact,<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> since also the wisdom of the
flesh is enmity against God, Rom. viii. 7, who hath
made foolish the wisdom of this world, 1 Cor. i. 20,
therefore never shall you rightly deprehend the
truth of God, nor submit yourselves to be guided
by the same, unless, laying aside all the high soaring
fancies and presumptuous conceits of natural and
worldly wisdom, you come in an unfeigned humility
and babe-like simplicity to be edified by the word
of righteousness. And far less shall you ever take
up the cross and follow Christ (as you are required),
except, first of all, you labour and learn to
deny yourselves, Matth. xvi. 24, that is, to make no
reckoning what come of yourselves, and of all that
you have in the world, so that God have glory and
yourselves a good conscience, in your doings or
sufferings.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-viii">[pg 1-viii]</span><a name="Pg1-viii" id="Pg1-viii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. If you would not be drawn away after the
error of the wicked, neither fall from your own
stedfastness, the apostle Peter teacheth you, that ye
must grow both in grace and knowledge, 2 Pet. iii.
18, for, if either your minds be darkened through
want of knowledge, or your affections frozen through
want of the love of God, then are you naked, and
not guarded against the tentations of the time.
Wherefore, as the perverters of the truth and simplicity
of religion do daily multiply errors, so must
you (shunning those shelves and quicksands of deceiving
errors which witty make-bates design for
you), labour daily for increase of knowledge, and
as they to their errors in opinion do add the overplus
of a licentious practice and lewd conversation,
so must you (having so much the more ado to flee
from their impiety), labour still for a greature measure
of the lively work of sanctifying grace; in
which respects Augustine saith well, that the adversaries
of the truth do this good to the true members
of the church, that the fall of those makes these to
take better hold upon God.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. Be not deceived, to think that they who so
eagerly press this course of conformity have any
such end as God's glory, or the good of his church
and profit of religion. When a violent urger of the
ceremonies pretendeth religious respects for his
proceedings, it may be well answered in Hillary's<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> words.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Subrepis nomine blandienti, occidis specie religionis</span></span>—Thou
privily creepest in with an enticing
title, thou killest with the pretence of religion, for,
1. It is most evidently true of these ceremonies,
which our divines<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
say of the gestures and rites
used in the mass, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are all frivolous and
hypocritical, stealing away true devotion from the
heart, and making men to rest in the outward gestures
of the body.”</span> There is more sound religion
among them who refuse, than among them who receive
the same, even our enemies themselves being
judges, the reason whereof let me give in the words
of one of our opposites<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Supervacua hoec occupatio
circa traditiones humanas, gignit semper ignorantiam
et contemptum proeceptorum divinorum</span></span>—This needless
business about human traditions doth ever
beget the ignorance and contempt of divine commandments.
2. Where read we that the servants
of God have at any time sought to advance religion
by such hideous courses of stern violence, as are
intended and assayed against us by those who press
the ceremonies upon us? The jirking and nibbling
of their unformal huggermugger cometh nearer to
sycophancy than to sincerity, and is sibber to appeaching
hostility than fraternal charity, for just
so they deal with us as the Arians did with the catholics
of old. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sinceros</span></span>, &amp;c.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The sincere teachers
of the churches they delated and accused before magistrates,
as if they alone did continually perturb
the church's peace and tranquillity, and did only
labour that the divided churches might never again
piously grow together, and by this calumny they
persuaded politic and civil men (who did not well
enough understand this business), that the godly
teachers of the churches should be cast forth into
exile, and the Arian wolves should be sent into the
sheepfolds of Christ.”</span> Now, forasmuch as God

or righteousness with cruelty therefore, if our
opposites would make it evident that they are in
very deed led by religious aims let them resile from
their violent proceedings, and deal with us in the
spirit of meekness showing us from God's word and
good reason the equity of their cause, and iniquity
of ours, wherein we require no other thing of them,
than that which Lactantius required of the adversaries
of his profession, even that they would debate
the matter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verbis pontius quam verberibus</span></span>—by words

of religion, how comes it to pass, that whilst they
make so much ado and move every stone against us
for our modest refusing of obedience to certain ordinances
of men, which in our consciences we are
persuaded to be unlawful, they manumiss and set
free the simony, lying, swearing, profanation of the
Sabbath, drunkenness, whoredom, with other gross
and scandalous vices of some of their own side, by
which God's own commandments are most fearfully
violated? This just recrimination we may well use
for our own most lawful defence. Neither do we
hereby intend any man's shame (God knows), but
his reformation rather. We wish from our hearts
we had no reason to challenge our opposites of that
superstition taxed in the Pharisees, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod argubant

V. Do not account ceremonies to be matters of so
small importance that we need not stand much upon
them, for, as Hooker<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>
observeth, a ceremony, through custom, worketh very much with people.
Dr Burges allegeth<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>
for his writing about ceremonies, that the matter is important for the consequence
of it. Camero<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>
thinketh so much of ceremonies, that he holdeth our simplicity to notify that
we have the true religion, and that the religion of
Papists is superstitious because of their ceremonies.
To say the truth, a church is in so far true or hypocritical
as it mixeth or not mixeth human inventions
with God's holy worship, and hence the
Magdeburgians profess,<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>
that they write of the ceremonies for making a difference betwixt a true
and a hypocritical church. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vere enim ecclesia, &amp;c.</span></span>—for
a true church, as it retains pure doctrine, so also
it keeps simplicity of ceremonies, &amp;c., but a hypocritical
church, as it departs from pure doctrine, so
for the most part it changeth and augmenteth the
ceremonies instituted of God, and multiplieth its
own traditions, &amp;c. And as touching our controverted
ceremonies in particular, if you consider
what we have written against them, you shall easily
perceive that they are matters of no small, but very
great consequence. Howbeit these be but the beginnings
of evils, and there is a worse gallimaufry
gobber-wise prepared. It hath been observed of the
warring Turks<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
that often they used this notable
deceit—to send a lying rumour and a vain tumult
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-x">[pg 1-x]</span><a name="Pg1-x" id="Pg1-x" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of war to one place, but, in the meanwhile, to address
their true forces to another place, that so they
might surprise those who have been unwarily led by
pernicious credulity. So have we manifest (alas
too, too manifest) reasons to make us conceive, that
whilst the chief urgers of the course of conformity
are skirmishing with us about the trifling ceremonies
(as some men count them), they are but labouring
to hold our thoughts so bent and intent
upon those smaller quarrels, that we may forget to
distinguish betwixt evils immanent and evils imminent,
and that we be not too much awake to espy
their secret sleight in compassing further aims.

VI. Neither let the pretence of peace and unity
cool your fervour, or make you spare to oppose
yourselves unto those idle and idolised ceremonies
against which we dispute, for whilst our opposites
make a vain show and pretence of peace, they do
like the Romans,<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>
who built the Temple of Concord
just in the place where the seditious outrages of the
two Gracchi, Tiberius and Caius, had been acted,
which temple,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
in the subsequent times, did not restrain,
but, by the contrary, gave further scope unto
more bloody seditions, so that they should have built
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discord</span></em> a temple in that place rather than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concord</span></em>,
as Augustine pleasantly tickleth them. Do our
opposites think that the bane of peace is never
in yielding to the course of the time, but ever in
refusing to yield? Or will they not rather acknowledge,
that as a man is said to be made drunk by
drinking the water of Lyncestus, a river of Macedonia,<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>
no less than if he had filled himself with the
strongest wine, so one may be inebriate with a contentious
humour in standing stiffly for yielding, as
well as in standing stedfastly for refusing? Peace
is violated by the oppugners of the truth, but established
by the possessors of the same, for (as was
rightly said by Georgius Scolarius in the Council of
Florence<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>)
the church's peace <span class="tei tei-q">“can neither stay
among men, the truth being unknown, neither can
it but needs return, the truth being known.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nec
veritate ignorata manere inter homines potest, nec illa
agnita necessario non redire.</span></span> We must therefore
be mortised together, not by the subscudines of
error, but by the bands of truth and unity of faith.
And we go the true way to regain peace whilst we
sue for the removal of those popish ceremonies
which have both occasioned and nourished the discord,
we only refuse that peace (falsely so called)
which will not permit us to brook purity, and that
because (as Joseph Hall<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>
noteth) St James' (chap.
iii. 17,) describeth the wisdom which is from above
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“first pure, then peaceable,”</span> whence it
cometh that there can be no concord betwixt Christ
and antichrist, nor any communion betwixt the
temple of God and idols, 2 Cor. vii. 15, 16. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atque ut
coelum</span></span>, &amp;c.: <span class="tei tei-q">“And though heaven and earth should
happen to be mingled together, yet the sincere worship
of God and his sacred truth, wherein eternal salvation
is laid up for us, should worthily be unto us of
more estimation than a hundred worlds,”</span> saith Calvin.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> John Fox<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> judgeth it better to contend against
those who prefer their own traditions to the commandments
of God, than to be at peace with them.
True it is,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pax optima rerum, quas homini
novisse datum est.</span></span>—Yet I trust we may use the
words of that great adiaphorist, Georgius Cassander—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ea

is true and solid Christian peace which is conjoined
with the glory of God and the obedience of his will,
and is rejoined from all depravation of the heavenly
doctrine and divine worship.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. Beware, also, you be not deceived with the
pretence of the church's consent, and of uniformity
as well with the ancient church as with the now
reformed churches, in the forms and customs of
both, for, 1. Our opposites cannot show that the
sign of the cross was received and used in the
church before Tertullian, except they allege either
the Montanists or the Valentian heretics for it.
Neither yet can they show, that apparel proper for
divine service, and distinguished from the common,
is more ancient than the days of Pope Cœlestinus,
nor lastly, that kneeling in the act of receiving the
communion was ever used before the time of Pope
Honorious III. They cannot prove any one of
the controverted ceremonies to have been in the
church the first two hundred years after Christ,
except the feast of Easter (which yet can neither be
proved to have been observed in the apostles' own
age, nor yet to have been established in the after age
by any law, but only to have crept in by a certain
private custom), and for some of them they cannot
find any clear testimony for a long time thereafter.
Now, in the third century,<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>
historiographers observe,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paulatum ceremoniæ auctæ sunt, hominum
superstitionorum opinionibus: unde in baptismo
unctionem olei, cruces signaculum, et osculum addiderunt</span></span>—Ceremonies
were by little and little augmented by the opinions of superstitious men,
whence it was that they added the unction of oil,
the sign of the cross, and a kiss in baptism. And
in the fourth century they say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Subinde magis magisque,
traditiones humanæ cumulatæ sunt</span></span>—Forthwith
human traditions were more and more augmented.
And so from that time forward vain and
idle ceremonies were still added to the worship of
God, till the same was, under Popery, wholly corrupted
with superstitious rites, yes, and Mr Sprint
hath told us, even of the first two hundred years
after Christ, that the <span class="tei tei-q">“devil, in those days, began to
sow his tares (as the watchmen began to sleep), both
of false doctrine and corrupt ceremonies.”</span> And
now, though some of the controverted ceremonies
have been kept and reserved in many (not all), the
reformed churches, yet they are not therefore to be
the better liked of. For the reason of the reservation
was, because some reverend divines who dealt and
laboured in the reformation of those churches, perceiving
the occurring lets and oppositions which were
caused by most dangerous schisms and seditions,
and by the raging of bloody wars, scarcely expected
to effectuate so much as the purging of the church
from fundamental errors and gross idolatry, which
wrought them to be content, that lesser abuses in
discipline and church policy should be then tolerated,
because they saw not how to overtake them
all at that time. In the meanwhile, they were so far
from desiring any of the churches to retain these
popish ceremonies, which might have convenient occasion
of ejecting them (far less to recal them, being
once ejected), that they testified plainly their
dislike of the same, and wished that those churches
wherein they lived, might have some blessed opportunity
to be rid of all such rotten relics, riven rags
and rotten remainders of Popery. All which, since
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-xii">[pg 1-xii]</span><a name="Pg1-xii" id="Pg1-xii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they were once purged away from the church of
Scotland and cast forth as things accursed into the
jakes of eternal detestation, how vile and abominable
may we now call the resuming of them? Or
what a piacular prevarication is it to borrow from
any other church which was less reformed, a pattern
of policy for this church which was more reformed.
But, 2. Though there could be more alleged
for the ceremonies than truly there can be,
either from the customs of the ancient or reformed
churches, yet do our opposites themselves profess,
that they will not justify all the ceremonies either
of the ancient or reformed churches. And, indeed,
who dare take this for a sure rule, that we ought to
follow every ancient and universally received custom?
For as Casaubon showeth, though the
church's consent ought not to be contemned, yet
we are not always to hold it for a law or a right
rule. And do not our divines teach, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil
faciendum est ad ahorum exemplum, sed juxta verbum</span></span>—Nothing
is to be done according to the example
of others, but according to the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ut
autem</span></span>, &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“As the multitude of them who err
(saith Osiander), so long prescription of time purchaseth
no patrociny to error.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. Moreover, because the foredeck and hind
deck of all our opposites' probations do resolve and
rest finally into the authority of a law, and authority
they use as a sharp knife to cut every Gordian
knot which they cannot unloose, and as a dreadful
peal to sound so loud in all ears that reason cannot
be heard, therefore we certiorate you with Calvin,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a acquievistis imperio, pessimo laqueo vos in
duistis</span></span>—If you have acquiesced in authority, you
have wrapped yourselves in a very evil snare. As
touching any ordinance of the church we say with
Whittaker, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Obediendum ecclesioe est sed jubents ac
docenti recta</span></span>—We are to obey the church but
commanding and teaching right things. Surely, if
we have not proved the controverted ceremonies to
be such things as are not right to be done we shall
straight obey all the ceremonial laws made thereanent,
and as for the civil magistrate's part, is it not
holden that he may not enjoin us <span class="tei tei-q">“to do that whereof
we have not good ground to do it of faith?”</span> and
that, <span class="tei tei-q">“although all thy external condition is in the
power of the magistrate, yet internal things, as the
keeping of faith, and obedience, and a good conscience,
are not in his power.”</span> For every one of us
<span class="tei tei-q">“shall give account of himself to God,”</span> Rom. xiv. 12,
but until you hear more in the dispute of the power
which either the church or the magistrate hath to
enact laws anent things belonging to the worship of
God, and of the binding power of the same, let me add
here touching human laws in general, that where we
have no other reason to warrant unto us the doing
of that which a human law prescribeth, beside the
bare will and authority of the law maker, in this
case a human law cannot bind us to obedience.
Aquinas holdeth with Isidore, that a human law
(among other conditions of it) must both be necessary
for removing of some evil, and likewise profitable
for guiding us to some good. Gregorius Sayrus
following them herein, saith, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Debet lex homines
a malo retrahere, et idio dicatur necessaria debet
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-xiii">[pg 1-xiii]</span><a name="Pg1-xiii" id="Pg1-xiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
etiam promovere in bonum, et ideo dicitur utilis</span></span>—A
law ought to draw back men from evil, and therefore
is called necessary, it ought also to promove
them unto good, and therefore is called profitable.
Human laws, in Mr Hooker's judgment,<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> must teach what is good, and be made for the benefit of
men. Demosthenes<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>
describeth a law to be such a thing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cui convenit
omnibus parere</span></span> which it is convenient for every one to obey.
Camero<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> not
only alloweth us to seek a reason of the church's laws
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non enim</span></span> saith he, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verae ecclesiae libet
leges ferre quarum non reddat rationem</span></span>—It pleaseth not the
true church to make and publish laws, whereof she
giveth not a reason), but he<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
will likewise have us, in such things as concern the glory and honour of
God, not to obey the laws of any magistrate blindly
and without a reason. <span class="tei tei-q">“There was one (saith the
Bishop of Winchester<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>),
that would not have his will stand for reason, and was there none such
among the people of God? Yes, we find, 1 Sam.
ii, one of whom it is said, Thus it must be, for
Hophni will not have it so, but thus his reason is,
For he will not. And God grant none such may be
found among Christians.”</span> From Scripture we
learn, that neither hath the magistrate any power,
but for our good only, Rom. xiii. 4, nor yet
hath the church any power, but for our edification
only, Ephes. iv. 12. Law makers, therefore,
may not enjoin <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod libet</span></span>, that which liketh
them, nay, nor always <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod licet</span></span>, that which is
in itself lawful, but only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod expedit</span></span>, that which
is expedient and good to the use of edifying. And
to them we may well say with Tertullian,<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iniquam exercetis dominationem si ideo negatis licere quia
vultis, non quia debuit non licere</span></span>—You exercise an
unjust dominion, if, therefore, you deny anything
to be free, because you will so, not because it ought
not to be free. Besides all this, there is nothing
which any way pertaineth to the worship of God
left to the determination of human laws, beside the
mere circumstances, which neither have any holiness
in them, forasmuch as they have no other use and
praise in sacred than they have in civil things, nor
yet were particularly determinable in Scripture,
because they are infinite, but sacred, significant
ceremonies, such as cross, kneeling, surplice, holidays,
bishopping, &amp;c., which have no use and praise
except in religion only, and which, also, were most
easily determinate (yet not determined) within
those bounds which the wisdom of God did set to
his written word, are such things as God never left
to the determination of any human law. Neither
have men any power to burden us with those or
such like ordinances, <span class="tei tei-q">“For (saith not our Lord
himself to the churches), I will put upon you none
other burden, but that which ye have already, hold
fast till I come,”</span> Rev. ii. 24, 25. Wherefore, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro hac</span></span>,
&amp;c., for this liberty we ought stoutly to fight against
false teachers.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> Finally, it is to be noted, that though
in some things we may and do commendably refuse
obedience to the laws of them whom God hath set
over us, yet are we ever obliged (and accordingly
intend) still to subject ourselves onto them, for to
be subject doth signify (as Zanchius showeth<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>), to be
placed under, to be subordinate, and so to give
honour and reverence to him who is above, which
may well stand without obedience to every one of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-xiv">[pg 1-xiv]</span><a name="Pg1-xiv" id="Pg1-xiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his laws. Yea, and Dr Field<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> also tells us, that
<span class="tei tei-q">“subjection is generally and absolutely required
where obedience is not.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IX. Forasmuch as some ignorant ones are of
opinion, that when they practise the ceremonies,
neither perceiving any unlawfulness in them (but,
by the contrary, being persuaded in their consciences
of the lawfulness of the same), nor yet having any
evil meaning (but intending God's glory and the
peace of the church), therefore they practise them
with a good conscience. Be not ye also deceived,
but rather advert unto this, that a peaceable conscience,
allowing that which a man doth, is not ever
a good conscience, but oftentimes an erring, bold,
presuming, secure, yea, perhaps, a seared conscience.
A good conscience, the testimony whereof giveth a
man true peace in his doings, is, and is only, such a
one as is rightly informed out of the word of God.
Neither doth a good meaning excuse any evil
action, or else they who killed the apostles were to
be excused, because in so doing they thought they
did God good service, John xiv. 2. It is the observation
even of Papists, that men may commit many
a soul-ruining scandal, though they intend no such
thing as the ruin of souls.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
X. If once you yield to these English ceremonies,
think not that thereafter you can keep yourselves
back from any greater evils, or grosser corruptions
which they draw after them; for as it is just
with God to give such men over to strong delusions
as have not received the love of the truth, nor taken
pleasure in the sincerity of his worship, 2 Thess. ii.
10, 11; so there is not a more deceitful and dangerous
temptation than in yielding to the beginnings
of evil. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that is unjust in the least, is
also unjust in much”</span> saith he who could not lie,
Luke xvi. 20. When Uriah the priest had once
pleased king Ahaz, in making an altar like unto
that at Damascus, he was afterwards led on to
please him in a greater matter, even in forsaking
the altar of the Lord, and in offering all the sacrifices
upon the altar of Damascus, 2 Kings xvi. 10-16.
All your winning or losing of a good conscience,
is in your first buying; for such is the deceitfulness
of sin, and the cunning conveyance of that

XI. Do not reckon it enough to bear within the
inclosure of your secret thoughts a certain dislike
of the ceremonies and other abuses now set afoot,
except both by profession and action you evidence
the same, and so show your faith by your fact. We
are constrained to say to some among you, with
Elijah, <span class="tei tei-q">“How long halt ye between two opinions?”</span>
1 Kings xviii. 21; and to call unto you, with Moses,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who is on the Lord's side?”</span> Exod. xxxii. 26.
Who? <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not deceived; God is not mocked;”</span>
Gal. vi. 7; and, <span class="tei tei-q">“No man can serve two masters,”</span>
Mat. vi. 24. However, he that is not against us,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro tanto</span></span>, is with us, Mark ix. 40, that is, in so far
he so obligeth himself unto us as that he cannot
speak lightly evil of our cause, and we therein rejoice,
and will rejoice, Phil. i. 18; yet, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span></span>,
he that is not with us is against us, Matt. xii. 30;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-xv">[pg 1-xv]</span><a name="Pg1-xv" id="Pg1-xv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that is, he who by profession and practice showeth
not himself to be on our side, is accounted before
God to be our enemy.

XII. Think not the wounds which the church hath
received by means of these nocent ceremonies to be
so deadly and desperate, as if there were no balm in
Gilead; neither suffer your minds so far to miscarry
as to think that ye wish well to the church,
and are heartily sorry that matters frame with her
as they do, whilst, in the meantime, you essay no
means, you take no pains and travail for her help.
When king Ahasuerus had given forth a decree for
the utter extirpation of the Jews, Mordecai feared
not to tell Esther, that if she should then hold her
peace enlargement and deliverance should arise unto
the Jews from another place, but she and her father's
house should be destroyed; whereupon she, after
three days' humiliation and prayer to God, put her
very life in hazard by going in to supplicate the king,
which was not according to the law, Esth. iv. But
now, alas! there are too many professors who detract
themselves from undergoing lesser hazards for
the church's liberty, yea, from using those very defences
which are according to the laws of the kingdom.
Yet most certain it is, that without giving
diligence in the use of the means, you shall neither
convince your adversaries, nor yet exonerate your
own consciences, nor, lastly, have such comfort in the
day of your suffering as otherwise you should. I
know that principally, and, above all, we are to offer
up to God prayers and supplications, with strong
crying and tears, which are the weapons of our spiritual
warfare, Heb. v. 7; but as this ought to be
done, so the achieving of other secondary means
ought not to be left undone.

If you disregard these things whereof, in the
name of God, I have admonished you, and draw
back your helping hands from the reproached and

Christianity was preached and professed in this

the gospel hath been longer continued in purity and
peace with us than with any church in Europe:
moreover, as the Church of Scotland hath treacherously
broken her bonds of oath and subscription
wherewith other churches about us were not so
tied; and, finally, as Almighty God, though he
hath almost consumed other churches by his dreadful
judgments, yet hath showed far greater long-suffering
kindness towards us, to reclaim us to repentance,
though, notwithstanding all this, we go on
in a most doleful security, induration, blindness, and
backsliding: so now, in the most ordinary course
of God's justice, we are certainly to expect, that after
so many mercies, so great long-suffering, and such a
long day of grace, all despised, he is to send upon us
such judgments as should not be believed though
they were told. O Scotland! understand and turn
again, or else, as God lives, most terrible judgments
are abiding thee.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How good reason those wise men had for them who did not allow of the English popish
ceremonies at the first introducing of these novations into the Church of Scotland,
foreseeing the bad effects and dangerous evils which might ensue thereupon, and how
greatly the other sort were mistaken who did then yield to the same, apprehending no
danger in them, it is this day too too apparent to us whose thoughts concerning the event
of this course cannot be holden in suspense betwixt the apprehensions of fear and
expectations of hope, because doleful experience hath made us feel that which the wiser
sort before did fear. Since, then, this church, which was once a praise in the earth, is
now brought to a most deplorable and daily increasing desolation by the means of these
ceremonies, which have been both the sparkles to kindle, and the bellows to blow up, the
consuming fire of intestine dissensions among us, it concerneth all her children, not
only to cry out Ah! and Alas! and to <span class="tei tei-q">“bewail with the weeping of Jazer,”</span> Isa. xvi.
9, but also to bethink themselves most seriously how to succour their dear, though
distressed mother, in such a calamitous case. Our best endeavours which we are to employ
for this end, next unto praying earnestly <span class="tei tei-q">“for the peace of Jerusalem,”</span> Psal. cxxii.
6, are these: 1. So far as we have attained <span class="tei tei-q">“to walk by the same rule, to mind the
same thing,”</span> Phil. iii. 19, and to labour as much as is possible that the course of
the gospel, the doctrine of godliness, the practice of piety lie not behind, because of
our differing one from another about the ceremonies, lest otherwise τὸ ἔργον grow to be
πάρεργον. 2. In such things whereabout we agree not, to make diligent search and
inquiry for the truth. For to have our judgments in our heels, and so blindly to follow
every opinion which is broached, and squarely to conform unto every custom which is set
afoot, becometh not men who are endued with reason for discerning of things beseeming
from things not beseeming, far less Christians, who should have their senses exercised
to discern both good and evil. Heb. v. 14, and who have received a commandment <span class="tei tei-q">“to
prove all things,”</span> 1 Thess. v. 21, before they hold fast anything; and least of all
doth it become us who live in these most dangerous days, wherein
error and defection so much abound. 3. When we have attained to the acknowledging of
the truth, then to give a testimony unto the same, according to our vocation, contending
for the truth of God against the errors of men, for the purity of Christ
against the corruptions of Antichrist: For to understand the truth, and yet not contend
for it, argueth cowardliness, not courage; fainting, not fervour; lukewarmness, not love;
weakness, not valour. Wherefore, since we cannot impetrate from the troublers of our
Israel that true peace which derogateth not from the truth, we may not, we dare not,
leave off to debate with them. Among the laws of Solon, there was one which pronounced
him defamed and unhonest who, in a civil uproar among the citizens, sitteth
still a looker-on and a neuter (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plut. in Vita. Solon</span></span>); much more
deserve they to be so accounted of who shun to meddle with any controversy which
disquieted the church, whereas they should labour to win the adversaries of the truth,
and, if they prove obstinate, to defend and propugn the truth
against them. In things of this life (as Calvin
noteth in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist. ad Protect. Angl.</span></span>) we may remit so much of the
right as the love of
peace requireth, but as for the regiment of the church which is spiritual, and wherein
everything ought to be ordered according to the word of God, it is not in the power of
any mortal man <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quidquam hic aliis dare, aut in illorum gratiam
deflectere</span></span>. These considerations have
induced me to bestow some time, and to take some pains in the study of the controversies
which are agitated in this church about the ceremonies, and (after due
examination and discussion of the writings of such as have played the proctors for them)
to compile this ensuing dispute against them, both for exonering myself, and for
provoking of others to contend yet more for the truth, and for Zion's sake not to hold
their peace, nor be at rest, until the amiable light of long-wished-for peace break
forth out of all these confusions, Isa. lxii. 1; which, O Prince of Peace! hasten, who
<span class="tei tei-q">“wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us,”</span> Isa.
xxvi. 12.

Because polemic and eristic discourses must follow the adversaries at the heels
whithersoever they go, finding them out in all the lurking-places of their elaborate
subterfuges, and conflicting with them wheresoever they pitch, until not only all their
blows be awarded, but themselves also all derouted, therefore, perceiving the
informality of the Formalists to be such that sometimes they plead for the
controverted ceremonies as necessary, sometimes as expedient, sometimes as lawful,
and sometimes as indifferent, I resolve to follow the trace, and to evince,
by force of reason, that there is none of all those respects to justify either
the urging or the using of them. And albeit the Archbishop of Spalato
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pref. Libror. de Rep. Eccl.</span></span>)
cometh forth like an Olympic champion, stoutly brandishing and bravading,
and making his account that no antagonist can match him except a prelate, albeit likewise
the Bishop of Edinburgh (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proc. in Perth, Assembly</span></span>, part iii. p.
55) would have us to
think that we are not well advised to enter into combat with such Achillean strength as
they have on their side, yet must our opposites know, that we have more daring minds
than to be dashed with the vain flourish of their great words. Wherefore, in all these
four ways wherein I am to draw the line of my dispute, I will not shun to encounter and
handle strokes with the most valiant champions of that faction,
knowing that—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trophoeum ferre
me à forti viro, pulchrum est: sin autem et vincar, vinci à tali nullum
est probrum</span></span>—But
what? Shall I speak doubtfully of the victory, or fear the foil? Nay, I consider
that there is none of them so strong as he was who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“We can do nothing against the
truth, but for the truth,”</span> 2 Cor. xxiii. 8. I will therefore boldly adventure to
combat with them even where they seem to be strongest, and to discuss their best
arguments, allegations, answers, assertions, and distinctions. And my dispute shall
consist of four parts, according to those four pretences which are given out for the
ceremonies, which, being so different one from another, must be severally examined. The
lawfulness of a thing is in that it may be done; the indifferency of it in that it may
either be done or left undone, the expediency of it in that it is done profitably; and
the necessity of it in that it may not be left undone. I will begin with the last
respect first, as that which is the weightiest.

practice; 2. From their pleading. In their
practice, who seeth not that they would tie
the people of God to a necessity of submitting
their necks to this heavy yoke of human
ceremonies? which are with more vehemency,
forwardness, and strictness urged,
than the weighty matters of the law of God,
and the refusing whereof is far more inhibited,
menaced, espied, delated, aggravated,
censured, and punished, than idolatry, Popery,
blasphemy, swearing, profanation of
the Sabbath, murder, adultery, &amp;c. Both
preachers and people have been, and are,
fined, confined, imprisoned, banished, censured,
and punished so severely, that he
may well say of them that which our divines
say of the Papists, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hoec sua inventa Decalago

they make not only as much, but more

about the most necessary things in religion,
their practice herein makes it too, too apparent
what necessity they annex to them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect</span></span>. 2. And if we will hearken to their
pleading it tells no less; for howbeit they
plead for their ceremonies, as things indifferent
in their own nature, yet, when the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-002">[pg 1-002]</span><a name="Pg1-002" id="Pg1-002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ceremonies are considered as the ordinances
of the church, they plead for them as things
necessary. M. G. Powel, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Consideration
of the Arguments directed to the
High Court of Parliament in behalf of
the Ministers suspended and deprived</span></span>
(ans. 3 to arg. 16), hath these words, yea,
these particulars: <span class="tei tei-q">“Subscription, ceremonies,
&amp;c., being imposed by the church, and
commanded by the magistrate, are necessary
to be observed under the pain of sin.”</span> The
Bishop of Edinburgh resolves us concerning
the necessity of giving obedience to the laws
of the church, enacted anent the ceremonies,
thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Where a man hath not a law,
his judgment is the rule of his conscience,
but where there is a law, the law must be
the rule. As, for example, before that apostolical
canon that forbade to eat blood or
strangled things, every man might have
done that which in his conscience he thought
most expedient, &amp;c., but after the making
and the publication of the canon that enjoined
abstinence, the same was to rule their
consciences. And, therefore, after that time,
albeit a man had thought in his own private
judgment that to abstain from these things
was not expedient, &amp;c. yet, in that case, he
ought not to have eaten, because now the
will of the law, and not the judgment of his
own mind, was the rule of his conscience.”</span><a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>
The Archbishop of St Andrews, to the
same purpose saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“In things indifferent
we must always esteem that to be best and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-003">[pg 1-003]</span><a name="Pg1-003" id="Pg1-003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most seemly which seemeth so in the eye of
public authority, neither is it for private
men to control public judgment, as they
cannot make public constitutions, so they
may not control nor disobey them, being
once made, indeed authority ought to look
well to this, that it prescribe nothing but
rightly, appoint no rights nor orders in the
church but such as may set forward godliness
and piety, yet, put the case, that some
be otherwise established, they must be obeyed
by such as are members of that church,
as long as they have the force of a constitution,
&amp;c. But thou wilt say, My conscience
suffers me not to obey, for I am persuaded
that such things are not right, nor appointed.
I answer thee, In matters of this nature
and quality the sentence of thy superiors
ought to direct thee, and that is a sufficient
ground to thy conscience for obeying.”</span><a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>
Thus we see that they urge the
ceremonies, not only with a necessity of
practice upon the outward man, but also
with a necessity of opinion upon the conscience,
and that merely because of the
church's determination and appointment;
yea, Dr Mortoune maketh kneeling in the
act of receiving the communion to be in some
sort necessary in itself, for he maintaineth,<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>
that though it be not essentially necessary
as food, yet it is accidentally necessary
as physic. Nay, some of them are yet more
absurd, who plainly call the ceremonies necessary
in themselves,<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> beside the constitution
of the church. Others of them, who
confess the ceremonies to be not only unnecessary,<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>
but also inconvenient, do, notwithstanding,
plead for them as things necessary.
Dr Burges tells us,<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> that some of his side
think that ceremonies are inconvenient, but
withal he discovers to us a strange mystery
brought out of the unsearchable deepness of
his piercing conception, holding that such
things as not only are not at all necessary in
themselves,<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> but are inconvenient too, may
yet be urged as necessary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect</span></span>. 3. The urging of these ceremonies
as necessary, if there were no more, is a sufficient
reason for our refusing them. <span class="tei tei-q">“To
the precepts of God (saith Balduine) nothing
is to be added,<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> Deut. xii. Now God

hath commanded these things which are necessary.
The rites of the church are not
necessary, wherefore, if the abrogation or
usurpation of any rite be urged as necessary,
then is an addition made to the commandment
of God, which is forbidden in the
word, and, by consequence, it cannot oblige
me, neither should anything herein be yielded
unto.”</span> Who can purge these ceremonies
in controversy among us of gross superstition,
since they are urged as things necessary?
But of this superstition we shall hear
afterward in its proper place.

the urging of the ceremonies as necessary
doth take away our Christian liberty, I will
make it evident in four points.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. First, They are imposed with a
necessity of practice. Spotswood tells us,<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>
that public constitutions must be obeyed,
and that private men may not disobey them,
and thus is our practice adstricted in the
use of things which are not at all necessary,
and acknowledged <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gratis</span></span> by the urgers to
be indifferent, adstricted (I say) to one part
without liberty to the other, and that by
the mere authority of a human constitution,
whereas Christian liberty gives us freedom
both for the omission and for the observation
of a thing indifferent, except some other
reason do adstrict and restrain it than a
bare human constitution. Chrysostome, speaking
of such as are subject to bishops,<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> saith,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In potestate positum est obedire vel non.</span></span>

Polanus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">est per quam Christiani sunt

Calvin, speaking of our liberty
in things indifferent,<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> saith, We may <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eas

and places this liberty,<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tam in abstinendo

of the ancient church,<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">liberae fuerunt
horum rituum observationes in ecclesia.</span></span>
And what meaneth the Apostle while he
saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“If ye be dead with Christ from the
rudiments of the world, why, as though living
in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
(touch not, taste not, handle not,
which all are to perish with the using,) after
the commandments and doctrines of
men?”</span> Col. ii. 20-22. Surely he condemneth
not only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">humana decreta de ritibus</span></span>,
but also subjection and obedience to
such ordinances of men as take from us
liberty of practice in the use of things indifferent,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>
obedience (I say) for conscience
of their ordinances merely. What meaneth
also that place, 1 Cor. vii. 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not
ye the servants of men?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It forbids us,
(saith Paybody) to be the servants of men,
that is, in wicked or superstitious actions,
according to their perverse commandments
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-007">[pg 1-007]</span><a name="Pg1-007" id="Pg1-007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or desires.”</span><a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> If he mean of actions that are
wicked or superstitious in themselves, then
it followeth, that to be subject unto those
ordinances, <span class="tei tei-q">“Touch not, taste not, handle
not,”</span> is not to be the servants of men, because
these actions are not wicked and superstitious
in themselves. Not touching, not
tasting, not handling, are in themselves indifferent.
But if he mean of actions which
are wicked and superstitious, in respect of
circumstances, then is his restrictive gloss
senseless; for we can never be the servants
of men, but in such wicked and superstitious
actions, if there were no more but giving
obedience to such ordinances as are imposed
with a necessity upon us, and that merely
for conscience of the ordinance, it is enough
to infect the actions with superstition, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sunt
hominum servi</span></span>, saith Bullinqer,<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qui aliquid
in gratiam hominum faciunt</span></span>. This
is nearer the truth; for to tie ourselves to
the doing of anything for the will or pleasure
of men, when our conscience can find
no other reason for the doing of it, were indeed
to make ourselves the servants of men.
Far be it then from us to submit our necks
to such a heavy yoke of human precepts, as
would overload and undo us. Nay, we will
stedfastly resist such unchristian tyranny as
goeth about to spoil us of Christian liberty,
taking that for certain which we find in
Cyprian,<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Two things are here replied, 1.
That there is reason for adstricting of our
practice in these things, because we are
commanded to obey them that have the rule
over us, and to submit ourselves, Heb. xiii.
17,<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> and to submit ourselves to every ordinance
of man for the Lord's sake, 1 Pet. ii.
16, and that except public constitutions must
needs be obeyed, there can be no order,<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> but
all shall be filled with strife and contention.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. As touching obedience to those that
are set over us, if they mean not to tyrannise
over the Lord's inheritance, 1 Pet.
v. 3; and to make the commandments of
God of no effect by their traditions, Mark
vii. 9, they must give us leave to try their
precepts by the sure will of God's word;
and when we find that they require of us
anything in the worship of God which is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-008">[pg 1-008]</span><a name="Pg1-008" id="Pg1-008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
either against or beside his written word,
then modestly to refuse obedience, which is
the only way for order, and shunning of
strife and contention. It will be said again,
that except we prove the things commanded
by those who are set over us to be unlawful
in themselves, we cannot be allowed to refuse
obedience to their ordinances. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>
This unlawfulness of the ceremonies in themselves
hath been proved by us already, and
shall yet again be proved in this dispute.
But put the case, they were lawful in themselves,
yet have we good reason for refusing
them: <span class="tei tei-q">“David thought the feeding of his
body was cause sufficient to break the law of
the shew-bread; Christ thought the satisfying
of the disciples' hunger to be cause sufficient
to break the ceremony of the Sabbath.
He thought, also, that the healing of
the lepers' bodies was a just excuse to break
the law that forbade the touching of them;
much more, then, may we think now in our
estimation, that the feeding of other men's
souls, the satisfying of our own consciences,
together with the consciences of other men,
and the healing of men's superstition and
spiritual leprosy, are causes sufficient to break
the law of the ceremonies and of the cross,
which are not God's but men's,”</span> saith Parker.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>
2. As touching submission or subjection,
we say with Dr Field,<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that subjection
is generally and absolutely required where
obedience is not,</span></em> and even when our consciences
suffer us not to obey, yet still we
submit and subject ourselves, and neither do
nor shall (I trust) show any the least contempt
of authority.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. Secondly, It is replied, that our
Christian liberty is not taken away when
practice is restrained, because conscience is
still left free. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Christian liberty (saith
Paybody<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>),
is not taken away by the necessity
of doing a thing indifferent, or not doing,
but only by that necessity which takes
away the opinion or persuasion of its indifferency,”</span>
So saith Dr Burges,<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“That
the ceremonies in question are ordained to
be used necessarily, though the judgment
concerning them, and immediate conscience
to God, be left free.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Who doubts
of this, that liberty of practice may be restrained
in the use of things which are in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-009">[pg 1-009]</span><a name="Pg1-009" id="Pg1-009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
themselves indifferent? But, yet, if the
bare authority of an ecclesiastical law, without
any other reason than the will and pleasure
of men, be made to restrain practice,
then is Christian liberty taken away. Junius
saith,<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">externum opus ligatur</span></span>
from the use of things indifferent, when the
conscience is not bound; but in that same
place he showeth, that the outward action is
bound and restrained only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo usque circumstantiae
ob quas necessitas imperata
est, se extendunt</span></span>. So that it is not the
authority of an ecclesiastical law, but the
occasion and ground of it, which adstricts
the practice when the conscience is left free.
2. When the authority of the church's constitution
is obtruded to bind and restrain the
practice of Christians in the use of things
indifferent, they are bereaved of their liberty,
as well as if an opinion of necessity were
borne in upon their consciences. Therefore
we see when the Apostle, 1 Cor. vii., gives
liberty of marriage, he doth not only leave
the conscience free in its judgment of the
lawfulness of marriage, but also give liberty
of practice to marry or not to marry. And
Col. ii. 21, when he giveth instances of such
human ordinances as take away Christian
liberty, he saith not, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you must think that
you may not touch</span></em>, &amp;c., but <span class="tei tei-q">“touch not,”</span>
&amp;c., telling us, that when the practice is restrained
from touching, tasting, handling,
by the ordinances of men, then is Christian
liberty spoiled, though the conscience be left
free. Camero, speaking of the servitude
which is opposed to Christian liberty, saith,<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a>
that it is either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animi servitus</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">corporis
servitus</span></span>. Then if the outward man be
brought in bondage, this makes up spiritual
thraldom, though there be no more. But,
3. The ceremonies are imposed with an opinion
of necessity upon the conscience itself,
for proof whereof I proceed to the next
point.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. Bishop Lindsey hath told
us,<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> that
the will of the law must be the rule of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-010">[pg 1-010]</span><a name="Pg1-010" id="Pg1-010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conscience, so that conscience may not judge
other ways than the law determines. Bishop
Spotswood will have the sentence of
superiors to direct the conscience,<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> and will
have us to esteem that to be best and most
seemly which seemeth so to them. Bishop
Andrews, speaking of ceremonies,<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> not only
will have every person inviolably to observe
the rites and customs of his own church, but
also will have the ordinances about those
rites to be urged under pain of the anathema.
I know not what the binding of the
conscience is, if this be not it: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolus gemendi
partes relinquit, non cogendi auctoritatem
tribuit ministris quibus plebs non
auscultat</span></span>.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> And shall they who call themselves
the apostles' successors, compel, constrain

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nullam vim ipsorum conscientiis illatum
iri</span></span>. And shall a popish prince speak more
reasonable than protestant prelates? But
to make it yet more and plentifully to appear
how miserably our opposites would enthral
our consciences, I will here show, 1.
What the binding of the conscience is. 2.
How the laws of the church may be said to
bind. 3. What is the judgment of formalists
touching the binding-power of ecclesiastical
laws.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. Concerning the first of these we
will hear what Dr Field saith:<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“To bind
the conscience (saith he) is to bind the soul
and spirit of man, with the fear of such punishments
(to be inflicted by him that so bindeth)
as the conscience feareth; that is, as
men fear, though none but God and themselves
be privy to their doings; now these
are only such as God only inflicteth,”</span> &amp;c.
This description is too imperfect, and deserves
to be corrected. To bind the conscience
is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">illam auctoritatem habere, ut
conscientia illi subjicere sese debeat, ita ut
peccatum sit, si contra illam quidquam
fiat</span></span>, saith Ames.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The binder (saith Perkins<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a>)
is that thing whatsoever which hath
power and authority over conscience to order
it. To bind is to urge, cause, and constrain
it in every action, either to accuse for sin,
or to excuse for well-doing; or to say, this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-011">[pg 1-011]</span><a name="Pg1-011" id="Pg1-011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may be done, or it may not be done.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“To
bind the conscience (saith Alsted<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">est illam urgere et adigere, ut vel excuset et accuset,
vel indicet quid fieri aut non fieri possit</span></span>.”</span>
Upon these descriptions, which have
more truth and reason in them, I infer that
whatsoever urges, or forces conscience to assent
to a thing as lawful, or a thing that
ought to be done, or dissent from a thing as
unlawful, or a thing which ought not to be
done, that is a binder of conscience, though
it did not bind the spirit of a man with the
fear of such punishments as God alone inflicteth.
For secluding all respect of punishment,
and not considering what will follow,
the very obliging of the conscience for
the time, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad assensum</span></span>, is a binding
of it.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Touching the second, it is certain
that human laws, as they come from men,
and in respect of any force or authority which
men can give them, have no power to bind
the conscience. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Neque enim cum hominibus,

This point he proveth in that chapter at
length, where he disputeth both against
temporal and spiritual coactive jurisdiction
in the church. If it be demanded to what
purpose serveth then the enacting of ecclesiastical
laws, since they have not in them
any power to bind the conscience, I answer,
The use and end for which ecclesiastical
laws do serve is, 1. For the plain discovery
of such things as the law of God or nature
do require of us, so that law which of itself
hath power to bind, cometh from the priests
and ministers of the Lord neither ἀντοκρατορικῶς
nor νομοθετικῶς, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">declarativè</span></span>,
Mal. ii. 7. 2. For declaring to us what is
fittest in such things as are, in their own
nature, indifferent, and neither enforced by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-012">[pg 1-012]</span><a name="Pg1-012" id="Pg1-012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the law of God nor nature, and which part
should be followed in these things as most
convenient. The laws of the church, then,
are appointed to let us see the necessity of
the first kind of things, and what is expedient
in the other kind of things, and therefore
they are more properly called directions,
instructions, admonitions, than laws.
For I speak of ecclesiastical laws <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua tales</span></span>,
that is, as they are the constitutions of men
who are set over us; thus considered, they
have only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vim dirigendi et monendi</span></span>.<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> It

best among the guides of God's church had
not so ill a meaning as to have all their constitutions

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. But as we have seen in what respect
the laws of the church do not bind, let
us now see how they may be said to bind.
That which bindeth is not the authority of
the church, nor any force which the church
can give to her laws. It must be then somewhat
else which maketh them able to bind,
when they bind at all, and that is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ratio legis</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the reason of the law,”</span> without which
the law itself cannot bind, and which hath
the chiefest and most principal power of
binding. An ecclesiastical law, saith Junius,<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>

sed</span></span> διατυπωσις aut canon, ac proindedirigit
quidem ut canon agentem voluntarie: non
autem necessitate cogit, ut lex etiam involuntarium
quod si forte ante accedit coactio,
ea non est de natura canonis sed altunde
pervenit. An ecclesiastical canon,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-013">[pg 1-013]</span><a name="Pg1-013" id="Pg1-013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

quod si accedat coactio, ea ecclesiastici

Calvin's judgment is,<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> that an ecclesiastical
canon binds, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">manifestam utilitatem
prae se fert</span></span>, and when either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tu prepon</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">charitatis ratio</span></span> doth require, that we impose
a necessity on our liberty. It binds
not, then, by its own authority in his mind.
And what saith the canon law itself?<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sed

Hence the professors of Leyden say,<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> that

may compare the constitutions of the church

said, that the laws of the church do not only
bind <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scandali et contemptus ratione</span></span>, as
Hospinian,<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> and in case <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">libertas fiat cum

not to give obedience to the laws of the
church, when they prescribe things necessary
or expedient for the eschewing of scandal,
and it were contempt to refuse obedience
to them, when we are not certainly
persuaded of the unlawfulness or inexpediency
of the things prescribed.

church's canons about rites, which serve for
public order and edification, do bind. We

by God's word.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scimus enim quaecunque

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. If any say that I derogate much
from the authority of the church when I do
nothing which she prescribeth, except I see
it lawful and expedient, because I should do
this much for the exhortation and admonition
of a brother. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. I give far more
reverence to the direction of the church than
to the admonition of a brother, because that
is ministerial, this fraternal, that comes from
authority, this only from charity, that is
public, this private, that is given by many,
this by one. And, finally, the church hath
a calling to direct me in some things wherein
a brother hath not. 2. If it be still instanced
that, in the point of obedience, I do
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-015">[pg 1-015]</span><a name="Pg1-015" id="Pg1-015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no more for the church than for any brother,
because I am bound to do that which
is made evident to be lawful and expedient,
though a private Christian do but exhort
me to it, or whether I be exhorted to it or
not. For answer to this I say, that I will
obey the directions of the church in many
things rather than the directions of a brother;
for in two things which are in themselves
indifferent, and none of them inexpedient,
I will do that which the church requireth,
though my brother should exhort
me to the contrary. But always I hold me
at this sure ground, that I am never bound
in conscience to obey the ordinances of the
church, except they be evidently lawful and
expedient. This is that, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sine quo non obligant</span></span>,
and also that which doth chiefly bind,
though it be not the only thing which bindeth.
Now, for making the matter more plain,
we must consider that the constitutions of
the church are either lawful or unlawful. If
unlawful, they bind not at all; if lawful,
they are either concerning things necessary,
as Acts xv. 28, and then the necessity of
the things doth bind, whether the church
ordain them or not; or else concerning
things indifferent, as when the church ordaineth,
that in great towns there shall be
sermon on such a day of the week, and public
prayers every day at such an hour. Here
it is not the bare authority of the church
that bindeth, without respect to the lawfulness
or expediency of the thing itself which
is ordained (else we were bound to do every
thing which the church ordains, were it
never so unlawful, for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod competit alicui
qua tali, competit omni tali</span></span>: we behold
the authority of the church making laws,
as well in unlawful ordinances as in lawful),
nor yet is it the lawfulness or expediency of
the thing itself, without respect to the ordinance
of the church (for possibly other times
and diets were as lawful, and expedient too,
for such exercises, as those ordained by the
church); but it is the authority of the church
prescribing a thing lawful or expedient. In
such a case, then neither doth the authority
of the church bind, except the thing be lawful
and expedient, nor doth the lawfulness
and expediency of the thing bind, except
the church ordain it; but both these jointly
do bind.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 8. I come now to examine what is
the judgment of formalists touching the
binding of the conscience by ecclesiastical
laws. Dr Field saith, that the question
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-016">[pg 1-016]</span><a name="Pg1-016" id="Pg1-016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should not be proposed, whether human laws
do bind the conscience, but <span class="tei tei-q">“whether binding
the outward man to the performance of
outward things by force and fear of outward
punishment to be inflicted by men, the non-performance
of such things, or the non-performance
of them with such affections as
were fit, be not a sin against God, of which
the conscience will accuse us,”</span><a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> &amp;c. Unto
this question thus proposed and understood
of human laws, and where no more is considered
as giving them power to bind, but
only the authority of those who make them;
some formalists do give (as I will show), and
all of them (being well advised) must give
an affirmative answer. And, I pray, what
did Bellarmine say more,<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> when, expressing
how conscience is subject to human authority,
he taught that conscience belongeth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad
humanum forum, quatenus homo ex praecepto
ita obligator ad opus externum faciendum,
ut si non faciat, judicat ipse in
conscientia sua se male facere, et hoc sufficit
ad conscientiam obligandam?</span></span> But
to proceed particularly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 9. I begin with Field himself, whose
resolution of the question proposed is,<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> that
we are bound only to give obedience to such
human laws as prescribe things profitable,
not for that human laws have power to bind
the conscience, but because the things they
command are of that nature, that not to
perform them is contrary to justice or charity.
Whereupon he concludeth out of Stapleton,
that we are bound to the performance
of things prescribed by human laws,
in such sort, that the non-performance of
them is sin, not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex sola legislatoris voluntate,
sed ex ipsa legum utilitate</span></span>. Let all
such as be of this man's mind not blame us
for denying of obedience to the constitutions
about the ceremonies, since we find (for certain)
no utility, but, by the contrary, much
inconveniency in them. If they say that we
must think those laws to be profitable or
convenient, which they, who are set over us,
think to be so, then they know not what they
say. For, exempting conscience from being
bound by human laws in one thing, they
would have it bound by them in another
thing. If conscience must needs judge that
to be profitable, which seemeth so to those
that are set over us, then, sure, is power
given to them for binding the conscience so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-017">[pg 1-017]</span><a name="Pg1-017" id="Pg1-017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
straitly, that it may not judge otherwise than
they judge, and force is placed in their bare
authority for necessitating and constraining
the assenting judgment of conscience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 10. Some man perhaps will say that
we are bound to obey the laws made about
the ceremonies, though not for the sole will
of the law-makers, nor yet for any utility of
the laws themselves, yet for this reason, that
scandal and contempt would follow in case we
do otherwise. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> We know that human
laws do bind in the case of scandal or contempt.
But that nonconformity is neither
scandal nor contempt, Parker hath made it
most evident.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> For, as touching contempt,
he showeth out of fathers, councils, canon
law, schoolmen, and modern divines, that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non obedire</span></span> is not contempt, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nolle
obedire</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">superbiendo repugnare</span></span>. Yea, out
of Formalists themselves, he showeth the
difference betwixt subjection and obedience.
Thereafter he pleadeth thus, and we with
him: <span class="tei tei-q">“What signs see men in us of pride
and contempt? What be our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cetera opera</span></span>
that bewray such an humour? Let it be
named wherein we go not two miles, when
we are commanded to go but one, yea, wherein
we go not as many miles as any shoe of
the preparation of the gospel will bear us.
What payment, what pain, what labour,
what taxation made us ever to murmur?
Survey our charges where we have laboured,
if they be not found to be of the faithfulest
subjects that be in the Lord, we deserve no
favour. Nay, there is wherein we stretch
our consciences to the utmost to conform
and to obey in divers matters. Are we refractory
in other things, as Balaam's ass
said to his master? Have I used to serve
thee so at other times?”</span> And as touching
scandal, he showeth first, that by our not
conforming, we do not scandalise superiors,
but edify them, although it may be we displease
them, of which we are sorry, even as
Joab displeased David when he contested
against the numbering of the people, yet
did he not scandalise David, but edify him.
And, secondly, whereas it might be alleged,
that nonconformity doth scandalise the people,
before whom it soundeth as it were an
alarm of disobedience, we reply with him,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Daniel will not omit the ceremony of looking
out at the window towards Jerusalem.
Mordecai omitteth the ceremony of bowing
the knee to Haman; Christ will not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-018">[pg 1-018]</span><a name="Pg1-018" id="Pg1-018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
use the ceremony of washing hands, though
a tradition of the elders and governors of the
church then being. The authority of the magistrate
was violated by these, and an incitement
to disobedience was in their ceremonial
breach, as much as there is now in ours.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 11. But some of our opposites go
about to derive the obligatory power of the
church's laws, not so much from the utility
of the laws themselves, or from any scandal
which should follow upon the not obeying of
them, as from the church's own authority
which maketh them. Camero speaketh of
two sorts of ecclesiastical laws:<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> 1. Such as
prescribe things frivolous or unjust, meaning
such things as (though they neither detract
anything from the glory of God, nor
cause any damage to our neighbour, yet)
bring some detriment to ourselves. 2. Such
as prescribe things belonging to order and
shunning of scandal. Touching the former,
he teacheth rightly, that conscience is never
bound to the obedience of such laws, except
only in the case of scandal and contempt,
and that if at any time such laws may be
neglected and not observed, without scandal
given, or contempt shown, no man's conscience
is holden with them. But touching
the other sort of the church's laws, he saith,
that they bind the conscience indirectly, not
only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectu materiæ præcepti</span></span> (which doth
not at all oblige, except in respect of the end
whereunto it is referred, namely, the conserving
of order, and the not giving of scandal),
but also <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectu præcipientis</span></span>, because
God will not have those who are set
over us in the church to be contemned. He
foresaw (belike), that whereas it is pretended
in behalf of those ecclesiastical laws which
enjoin the controverted ceremonies, that the
things which they prescribe pertain to order
and to the shunning of scandal, and so bind
the conscience indirectly in respect of the
end, one might answer, I am persuaded
upon evident grounds that those prescribed
ceremonies pertain not to order, and to the
shunning of scandal, but to misorder, and to
the giving of scandal; therefore he laboured
to bind such an one's conscience with another
tie, which is the authority of the law-makers.
And this authority he would have one
to take as ground enough to believe, that
that which the church prescribeth doth belong
to order and the shunning of scandal,
and in that persuasion to do it. But, 1.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-019">[pg 1-019]</span><a name="Pg1-019" id="Pg1-019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
How doth this doctrine differ from that
which himself setteth down as the opinion
of Papists,<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Posse los qui præsunt ecclesiæ,
cogere fideles ut id credant vel faciant,

by our writers,<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> that the apostles
never made things indifferent to be necessary,
except only in respect of scandal, and
that out of the case of scandal they still left
the consciences of men free, which observation
they gather from Acts XV. and 1 Cor.
x. Camero himself noteth,<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> that though the
church prescribed abstinence from things sacrificed
to idols, yet the Apostle would not
have the faithful to abstain for conscience'
sake: why then holdeth he, that beside the
end of shunning scandal and keeping order,
conscience is bound even by the church's
own authority? 3. As for the reason whereby
he would prove that the church's laws do
bind, even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectu præcipientis</span></span>, his form
of speaking is very bad. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus</span></span> (saith he)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non vult contemni præpositos ecclesiæ, nisi
justa et necessaria de causa.</span></span> Where falsely
he supposeth, not only that there may
occur a just and necessary cause of contemning
those whom God hath set over us in the
church, but, also, that the not obeying of
them inferreth the contemning of them.
Now, the not obeying of their laws inferreth
not the contemning of themselves (which
were not allowable), but only the contemning
of their laws. And as Jerome,<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> speaketh
of Daniel, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Et nunc Daniel regis jussa
contemnens</span></span>, &amp;c.; so we say of all superiors
in general, that we may sometimes
have just reasons for contemning their commandments,
yet are we not to contemn, but
to honour themselves. But, 4. Let us take
Camero's meaning to be, that God will not
have us to refuse obedience unto those who
are set over us in the church: none of our
opposites dare say, that God will have us to
obey those who are set over us in the church
in any other things than such as may be
done both lawfully and conveniently for the
shunning of scandal; and if so, then the
church's precept cannot bind, except as it is
grounded upon such or such reasons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 12. Bishop Spotswood and Bishop
Lindsey, in those words which I have heretofore
alleged out of them, are likewise of
opinion, that the sole will and authority of
the church doth bind the conscience to obedience.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-020">[pg 1-020]</span><a name="Pg1-020" id="Pg1-020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Spotswood will have us, without
more ado, to esteem that to be best and
most seemly, which seemeth so in the eye
of public authority. Is not this to bind the
conscience by the church's bare will and authority,
when I must needs constrain the
judgment of my conscience to be conformed
to the church's judgment, having no other
reason to move me hereunto but the sole
will and authority of the church? Further,
he will have us to obey even such things as
authority prescribeth not rightly (that is,
such rites as do not set forward godliness),
and that because they have the force of a
constitution. He saith that we should be
directed by the sentence of superiors, and
take it as a sufficient ground to our consciences
for obeying. Bellarmine speaketh
more reasonably:<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Legesæ human non obligant
sub pœna mortis æternæ, nisi quatenus
violatione legis humanæ offenditur
Deus.</span></span> Lindsey thinketh that the will of
the law must be the rule of our consciences;
he saith not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em> of the law, but the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> of the law. And when we talk with
the chief of our opposites, they would bind
us by sole authority, because they cannot do
it by any reason. But we answer out of
Pareus,<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a>
that the particular laws of the
church bind not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propter ipsum
speciale mandatum ecclesiæ. Ratio: quia

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 13. Thus we have found what power
they give to their canons about the ceremonies
for binding of our consciences, and that
a necessity not of practice only upon the outward
man, but of opinion also upon the conscience
is imposed by the sole will of the
law-makers. Wherefore, we pray God to
open their eyes, that they may see their
ceremonial laws to be substantial tyrannies
over the consciences of God's people. And
for ourselves, we stand to the judgment of
sounder divines, and we hold with Luther,<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unum Dominum

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. If Christian liberty be taken away,
by adstricting conscience in any, much more
by adstricting it in them who are fully persuaded
of the unlawfulness of the thing enjoined;
yet thus are we dealt with. Bishop
Lindsay gives us to understand, that after
the making and publication of an ecclesiastical
canon, about things of this nature, albeit
a man in his own private judgment
think another thing more expedient than
that which the canon prescribeth, yet in that
case his conscience must be ruled by the will
of the law, and not by his own judgment.
And Bishop Spotswood, to such as object,
that their conscience will not suffer them to
obey, because they are persuaded that such
things are not right, answereth; that the
sentence of their superiors ought to direct
them, and make their conscience yield to
obedience. Their words I have before transcribed.
By which it doth manifestly appear,
that they would bear dominion over
our consciences, not as lords only, by requiring
the willing and ready assent of our consciences
to those things which are urged
upon us by their sole will and authority, but
even as tyrants, not caring if they get so
much as constrained obedience, and if by
their authority they can compel conscience
to that which is contrary to the πληροφορια
and full persuasion which it hath conceived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. It will be said, that our consciences
are in an error, and therefore ought
to be corrected by the sentence of superiors,
whose authority and will doth bind us to receive
and embrace the ceremonies, though
our consciences do condemn them. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-022">[pg 1-022]</span><a name="Pg1-022" id="Pg1-022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Giving, and not granting, that our consciences
do err in condemning the ceremonies, yet,
so long as they cannot be otherwise persuaded,
the ceremonies ought not to be
urged upon us; for if we be made to do that
which our consciences do condemn, we are
made to sin, Rom. xiv. 23. It is an audacious
contempt, in Calvin's judgment,<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> to do
anything <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">repugnante conscientia</span></span>. The
learned Casuists teach us, that an erring
conscience, though <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non obligat</span></span>, yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ligat</span></span>;
though we be not obliged to do that which
it prescribeth, yet are we bound not to do
that which it condemneth. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quicquid fit
repugnante et reclamante conscientia, peccatum
est, etiamsi repugnantia ista gravem
errorem includat</span></span>, saith Alsted.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conscientia
erronca obligat, sic intelligendo,
quod faciens contra peccet</span></span>, saith Hemmingius.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>
This holds ever true of an erring
conscience about matters of fact, and especially
about things indifferent. If any say,
that hereby a necessity of sinning is laid on
them whose consciences are in an error, I
answer, that so long as a man keeps an erroneous
conscience, a necessity of sinning
lies on him, and that through his own fault.
This necessity ariseth from this supposition,
that he retain his erring conscience, and so
is not absolute, because he should inform his
conscience rightly, so that he may both do
that which he ought to do, and do it so from
the approbation of his conscience. If it be
said again, What should be done to them
who have not laid down the error of conscience,
but do still retain the same? I answer,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eligatur id quod tutius et melius
est</span></span>.<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a>
If therefore the error of conscience be about
weighty and necessary matters, then it is
better to urge men to the doing of a necessary
duty in the service of God, than to permit
them to neglect the same, because their
erring conscience disapproveth it; for example,
it is better to urge a profane man to
come and hear God's word than to suffer
him to neglect the hearing of the same, because
his conscience alloweth him not to
hear. But if the error of conscience be
about unnecessary things, or such as are in
themselves indifferent, then it is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars tutior</span></span>,
the surest and safest part not to urge
men to do that which in their consciences
they condemn. Wherefore, since the ceremonies
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-023">[pg 1-023]</span><a name="Pg1-023" id="Pg1-023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are not among the number of such
necessary things as may not be omitted
without the peril of salvation, the invincible
disallowance of our consciences should make
our opposites not press them upon us, because
by practising them we could not but
sin, in that our consciences judge them unlawful.
If any of our weak brethren think
that he must and should abstain from the
eating of flesh upon some certain day,
though this thing be in itself indifferent,
and not necessary, yet, saith Baldwin,<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“he
who is thus persuaded in his conscience, if
he should do the contrary, sinneth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Conscience, then, though erring,
doth ever bind in such sort, that he who doth
against his conscience sinneth against God.
Which is also the doctrine of Thomas.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> But,
without any more ado, it is sufficiently confirmed
from Scripture. For, was not their
conscience in an error who thought they
might not lawfully eat all sorts of meat? Yet
the Apostle showeth that their conscience,
as erring as it was, did so bind, that they
were damned if they should eat such meat
as they judged to be unclean, Rom. xiv. 14,
23. The reason wherefore an erring conscience
bindeth in this kind is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quoniam
agens</span></span>, &amp;c.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Because he who doth any
thing against his conscience doth it against
the will of God, though not materially and
truly, yet formally and by way of interpretation,
forsomuch as that which conscience
counselleth or prescribeth, it counselleth it
under the respect and account of the will of
God. He who reproacheth some private
man, taking him to be the king, is thought
to have hurt not the private man, but the
king himself. So he that contemneth his
conscience contemneth God himself, because
that which conscience counselleth or adviseth
is taken to be God's will.”</span> If I go with
certain men upon such a course as I judge
and esteem to be a treasonable conspiracy
against the king (though it be not so indeed),
would not his Majesty (if he knew so
much), and might he not, justly condemn
me as a wicked traitor? But how much
more will the King of kings condemn me
if I practice the ceremonies which I judge
in my conscience to be contrary to the will
of God, and to rob him of his royal prerogative?

be the servants of men, 1 Cor. vii. 23, is it not
his meaning that we should do nothing upon
the mere will and pleasure of men, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propter

the Jesuit expoundeth it,<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> illustrating what he
saith by another place, Eph. vi. 6, 7. Christian
servants thought it an unworthy thing
to serve wicked men,<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> neither yet took they
well with the serving of godly men, for that
they were all brethren in Christ. The Apostle
answereth them, that they did not the
will of man, because it was the will of man,
but because it was the will of God, and so
they served God rather than man, importing
that it were indeed a grievous yoke for
any Christian to do the will of man, if he
were not sure that it is according to the will
of God. Should any synod of the church
take more upon them than the synod of the
apostles did, who enjoined nothing at their
own pleasure, but only what they show to be
necessary, because of the law of charity? Acts
xv. 28. Or should Christians, who ought not
to be children, carried about with every wind,
Eph. iv. 14; who should be able to discern
both good and evil, Heb. v. 14; in whom the
word of God ought to dwell plentifully, Col.
iii. 16; who are commanded to beware of
men, Matt. x. 17; not to believe every spirit,
to prove all things, 1 John iv. 1; and to
judge of all that is said to them, 1 Thes. v.
21; should they, I say, be used as stocks and
stones, not capable of reason, and therefore
to be borne down by naked will and authority?
1 Cor. x. 15. Yet thus it fareth with us.
Bishop Lindsey will have the will of the law
to rule our consciences,<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> which is by interpretation,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione

equity of the law, but only the will of it, to
be our role. Bishop Spotswood<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> will have

a sufficient ground to our consciences for
obeying. Which is so much as to say, you
should not examine the reason and utility of
the law, the sentence of it is enough for
you: try no more when you hear the sentence
of superiors, rest your consciences upon
this as a sufficient ground: seek no other,
for their sentence must be obeyed. And
who among us knoweth not how, in the Assembly
of Perth, free reasoning was shut to
the door, and all ears were filled with the
dreadful pale of authority? There is this

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. That which hath been said against
all the controverted ceremonies in general,
I will now instance of festival days in particular,
and prove, both out of the law and
gospel, that they take away our liberty which
God hath given us, and which no human
power can take from us. Out of the law we
frame this argument: If the law of God
permit us to work all the six days of the
week, the law of man cannot inhibit us.
But the law of God doth permit us to work
all the six days of the week, therefore our
opposites deny not the assumption, which is
plain from the fourth commandment, <span class="tei tei-q">“Six
days shalt thou labour,”</span> &amp;c. But they would
have somewhat to say against the proposition,
which we will hear. Hooker tells us,<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a>
that those things that the law of God leaves
arbitrary and at liberty, are subject to the
positive ordinances of men. This, I must
say, is strange divinity, for if this were
true, then might the laws of men prohibit
marriage, because it is left arbitrary, 1 Cor.
vii. 36. Then might they also have discharged
the apostle Paul to take wages, because herein
he was at liberty, 1 Cor. ix. 11-13.

no privilege of inhibiting the use of those

and possession among subjects); but
power over all these is given to mankind.

But each particular man, and
not mankind alone, is permitted to labour
six days. Wherefore it is plain, that man's
liberty is not abridged in the other case as
in this, because mankind hath dominion over
these creatures, when some men only do exercise
the same, as well as if all men did
exercise it.

better,<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>
viz., that this liberty which God
hath given unto men for labour is not absolute,
but subject unto order. For, 1. What
tyranny is there so great, spoiling men wholly
of their liberty, but this pretence agreeth to
it? For, by order, he understandeth the
constitutions of our governors, as is clear
from his preceding words, so that this may
be alleged for a just excuse of any tyranny
of governors (that men must be subject unto
order), no less than for taking away from us
the liberty of labouring six days. 2. This
answer is nothing else but a begging of that
which is in question, for the present question
is, whether or not the constitutions of our
governors may inhibit us to labour all the
six days of the week, and yet he saith no
more, but that this liberty of labour must be
subject to order, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the constitutions of
governors. 3. Albeit we should most humbly
subject ourselves to our governors, yet
we may not submit our liberty to them,
which God hath graciously given us, because
we are forbidden to be the servants of men,
1 Cor. vii. 23; or to be entangled with the
yoke of bondage, Gal. v. 1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. Yet we must hear what the Bishop
can say against our proposition:<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If
under the law (saith he) God did not spoil
his people of liberty, when he appointed
them to rest two days at Pasche, one at
Whitsunday, &amp;c., how can the king's majesty
and the church be esteemed to spoil
us of our liberty, that command a cessation
from labour on three days?”</span> &amp;c. O horrible
blasphemy! O double deceitfulness! Blasphemy,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-029">[pg 1-029]</span><a name="Pg1-029" id="Pg1-029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
because so much power is ascribed to
the king and the church over us, as God
had over his people of old. God did justly
command his people, under the law, to rest
from labour on other days beside the Sabbath,
without wronging them; therefore the king
and the church may as justly, and with doing
as little wrong, command us to rest likewise,
because God, by a ceremonial law, did
hinder his people from the use of so much
liberty, as the moral law did give them;
therefore the king and the church may do so
also. Deceitfulness, in that he saith, God
did not spoil his people of liberty, &amp;c. We
know that, by appointing them to rest on
those days, God did not take away liberty
from his people, simply and absolutely, because
they had no more liberty than he did
allow to them by his laws, which he gave
by the hand of Moses, yet he did take away
that liberty which one part of his laws did
permit to them, viz., the fourth commandment
of the moral law, which permitted
them to labour six days. The Bishop knew
that this question in hand hath not to do
with liberty, in the general notion of it, but
with liberty which the moral law doth permit.
We say, then, that God took away
from his people Israel, some of the liberty
which his moral law permitted to them, because
he was the Lawgiver and Lord of the
law; and that the king and the church cannot
do the like with us, because they are no
more lords over God's law than the people
who are set under them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. But he hath yet more to say
against us: <span class="tei tei-q">“If the king (saith he) may
command a cessation from economical and
private works, for works civil and public,
such as the defence of the crown, the liberty
of the country, &amp;c., what reason have ye
why he may not enjoin a day of cessation
from all kind of bodily labour, for the honour
of God and exercise of religion?”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>
This kind of reasoning is most vicious, for
three respects: 1. It supposeth that he who
may command a cessation from one kind of
labour, upon one of the six days, may also
command a cessation from all kind of labour,
but there is a difference; for the law of God
hath allowed us to labour six days of every
week, which liberty no human power can
take from us. But we cannot say that the
law of God alloweth us six days of every
week to economical and private works (for
then we should never be bound to put our
hands to a public work), whence it cometh
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-030">[pg 1-030]</span><a name="Pg1-030" id="Pg1-030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the magistrate hath power left him to
command a cessation from some labour, but
not from all. 2. The Bishop reasoneth from
a cessation from ordinary labour for extraordinary
labour, to a cessation from ordinary
labour for no labour, for they who use their
weapons for the defence of the crown, or liberty
of the country, do not cease from labour,
but only change ordinary labour into
extraordinary, and private labour into public,
whereas our opposites plead for a cessation
from all labour upon their holidays.
3. He skippeth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de genere in genus</span></span>, because
the king may command a cessation for civil
works, therefore he may command a holy
rest for the exercise of religion, as if he had
so great power in sacred as in civil things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. The Bishop hath yet a third dart
to throw at us: <span class="tei tei-q">“If the church (saith he)<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a>
hath power, upon occasional motives, to appoint
occasional fasts or festivities, may not
she, for constant and eternal blessings,
which do infinitely excel all occasional benefits,
appoint ordinary times of commemoration
or thanksgiving?”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> There are
two reasons for which the church may and
should appoint fasts or festivities upon occasional
motives, and neither of them agreeth
with ordinary festivities. 1. Extraordinary
fasts, either for obtaining some great blessing,
or averting some great judgment, are
necessary means to be used in such cases,
likewise, extraordinary festivities are necessary
testifications of our thankfulness for the
benefits which we have impetrate by our
extraordinary fasts, but ordinary festivities,
for constant and eternal blessings, have no
necessary use. The celebration of set anniversary
days is no necessary mean for conserving
the commemoration of the benefits
of redemption, because we have occasion,
not only every Sabbath day, but every other
day, to call to mind these benefits, either in
hearing, or reading, or meditating upon
God's word. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dies Christo dicatos tollendos
existimo judicoque</span></span>, saith Danaeus<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quotidie nobis in evangelii proedicatione
nascitur, circumciditur, moritur, resurgit
Christus.</span></span> God hath given his church a
general precept for extraordinary fasts, Joel
i. 14, ii. 15, as likewise for extraordinary
festivities to praise God, and to give him
thanks in the public assembly of his people,
upon the occasional motive of some great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-031">[pg 1-031]</span><a name="Pg1-031" id="Pg1-031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
benefit which, by the means of our fasting
and praying, we have obtained, Zech. viii.
19 with vii. 3. If it be said that there is a
general command for set festivities, because
there is a command for preaching and hearing
the word, and for praising God for his
benefits; and that there is no precept for
particular fasts more than for particular festivities,
I answer: Albeit there is a command
for preaching and hearing the word, and for
praising God for his benefits, yet is there
no command (no, not in the most general
generality) for annexing these exercises of
religion to set anniversary days more than
to other days; whereas it is plain, that there
is a general command for fasting and humiliation
at some times more than at other
times. And as for particularities, all the
particular causes, occasions, and times of
fasting, could not be determined in Scripture,
because they are infinite, as Camero
saith.<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> But all the particular causes of set
festivities, and the number of the same,
might have been easily determined in Scripture,
since they are not, nor may not be infinite;
for the Bishop himself acknowledgeth,<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a>
that to appoint a festival day for every
week, cannot stand with charity, the inseparable
companion of piety. And albeit
so many were allowable, yet who seeth not
how easily the Scripture might have comprehended
them, because they are set, constant,
and anniversary times, observed for
permanent and continuing causes, and not
moveable or mutable, as fasts which are appointed
for occurring causes, and therefore
may be infinite. I conclude that, since
God's word hath given us a general command
for occasional fasts, and likewise particularly
determined sundry things anent
the causes, occasions, nature, and manner of
fastings, we may well say with Cartwright,<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a>
that days of fasting are appointed at <span class="tei tei-q">“such
times, and upon such occasions, as the Scripture
doth set forth; wherein because the
church commandeth nothing, but that which
God commandeth, the religious observation
of them, falleth unto the obedience of the
fourth commandment, as well as of the seventh
day itself.”</span>

fourth argument,<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> taken from the calling of

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-032">[pg 1-032]</span><a name="Pg1-032" id="Pg1-032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
labours to divine service, which argument
Tilen also beateth upon.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> There is
huge difference betwixt the rest which is
enjoined upon anniversary festivities, and
the rest which is required during the time
of the weekly meetings for divine worship.
For, 1. Upon festival days, rest from labour
is required all the day over, whereas, upon
the days of ordinary and weekly meetings,
rest is required only during the time of public
worship. 2. Cessation from labour, for
prayers or preaching on those appointed days
of the week, at some occasions may be omitted;
but the rest and commemoration appointed
by the church, to be precisely observed
upon the anniversary festival days,
must not be omitted, in the Bishop's judgment.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> 3. Men are straitly commanded
and compelled to rest from labour upon holidays;
but to leave work to come to the ordinary
weekly meetings, they are only exhorted.
And here I mark how the Bishop
contradicteth himself; for in one place where
his antagonist maintaineth truly, that the
craftsman cannot be lawfully commanded
nor compelled to leave his work and to go
to public divine service, except on the day
that the Lord hath sanctified, he replieth,<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“If he may be lawfully commanded to cease
from his labour during the time of divine
service, he may be as lawfully compelled to
obey the command.”</span> Who can give these
words any sense, or see anything in them
said against his antagonist's position, except
he be taken to say, that the craftsman may be
both commanded and compelled to leave his
work and go to divine service on the week-days
appointed for the same? Nay, he laboureth to
prove thus much out of the ninth head of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First Book of Discipline</span></span>, which saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“In
great towns we think expedient, that every
day there be either sermon or common prayers,”</span>
&amp;c., where there is nothing of compulsion,
or a forcing command, only there is
an exhortation. But ere the Bishop have
said much, he forgetteth himself, and tells
us,<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> that it were against equity and charity
to adstrict the husbandman to leave his
plough so oft as the days of weekly preaching
do return, but that, on the festival
days, reason would, that if he did not leave
his plough willingly, by authority he should
be forced. Which place confirmeth this
difference which we give betwixt rest on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-033">[pg 1-033]</span><a name="Pg1-033" id="Pg1-033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

prove that the imposing of the observation
of holidays doth bereave us of our liberty,
I take out of two places of the Apostle, the
one, Gal. iv. 10, where he finds fault with
the Galatians for observing of days, and
giveth them two reasons against them; the
one, ver. 3, They were a yoke of bondage
which neither they nor their fathers were
able to bear; another, ver, 8, They were
weak and beggarly rudiments, not beseeming
the Christian church, which is liberate
from the pedagogical instruction of the ceremonial
law. The other place is Col. ii. 16,
where the Apostle will have the Colossians
not to suffer themselves to be judged by any
man in respect of an holiday, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to be condemned
for not observing a holiday, for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judicare hic
significat culpae reum facere,</span></span><a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>
and the meaning is, suffer not yourselves to
be condemned by those false apostles, or by
any mortal man in the cause of meat, that
is, for meat or drink taken, or for any holiday,
or any part of an holiday neglected.<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a>
Two other reasons the Apostle giveth in
this place against festival days; one, ver.
17, What should we do with the shadow,
when we have the body? another, ver. 20,
Why should we be subject to human ordinances,
since through Christ we are dead to
them, and have nothing ado with them?
Now, by the same reasons are all holidays
to be condemned, as taking away Christian
liberty; and so, that which the Apostle saith
doth militate as well against them as against
any other holidays; for whereas it might be
thought, that the Apostle doth not condemn
all holidays, because both he permitteth
others to observe days, Rom. xiv. 5, and he
himself also did observe one of the Jewish
feasts, Acts xviii. 21: it is easily answered,
that our holidays have no warrant from
these places, except our opposites will say,
that they esteem their festival days holier
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-034">[pg 1-034]</span><a name="Pg1-034" id="Pg1-034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than other days, and that they observe the
Jewish festivities, neither of which they
do acknowledge, and if they did, yet they
must consider, that that which the Apostle
either said or did hereanent, is to be expounded
and understood of bearing with the
weak Jews, whom he permitted to esteem
one day above another, and for whose cause
he did, in his own practice, thus far apply
himself to their infirmity at that time when
they could not possibly be as yet fully and
thoroughly instructed concerning Christian
liberty, and the abrogation of the ceremonial
law, because the gospel was as yet not fully
propagated; and when the Mosaical rites
were like a dead man not yet buried, as
Augustine's simile runs. So that all this
can make nothing for holidays after the full
promulgation of the gospel, and after that
the Jewish ceremonies are not only dead,
but also buried, and so deadly to be used by
us. Hence it is, that the Apostle will not
bear with the observation of days in Christian
churches, who have known God, as he
speaks.

to these places which we allege against
them, that the Apostle condemneth the observation
of Judaical days, not of ecclesiastical
days, which the church instituteth for order
and policy; which evasion Bishop Lindsey<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>

to hold, that <span class="tei tei-q">“all the days whereof the
Apostle condemneth the observation were
Judaical days prescribed in the ceremonial
law,”</span> &amp;c. And this he is not contented to
maintain himself, but he will needs father it
upon his antagonist by such logic, forsooth, as
can infer <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quidlibet ex quodlibet.</span></span> The Apostle
comports with the observation of days
in the weak Jews, who understood not the
fulness of the Christian liberty, especially
since those days, having had the honour to
be once appointed by God himself, were to
be honourably buried; but the same Apostle
reproves the Galatians who had attained to
this liberty, and had once left off the observation
of days. What ground of consequence
can warrant such an illation from these premises
as this which the Bishop formeth,
namely, that <span class="tei tei-q">“all the days whereof the
Apostle condemned the observation were
Judaical days,”</span> &amp;c.

Apostle, we say, 1. If all the days whereof
the Apostle condemned the observation
were Judaical days prescribed in the ceremonial
law, then do our divines falsely interpret
the Apostle's words against popish
holidays, and the Papists do truly allege
that their holidays are not condemned by
the Apostle. The Rhemists affirm, that
the Apostle condemneth only Jewish days,<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>

condemned the observing of feasts which
God himself instituted, then much more
doth he condemn the observation of feasts of man's
devising. So Bellarmine allegeth,<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">loqui ibi Apostolum de judaeorum tantum
festis</span></span>. Hospinian, answering him, will have
the Apostle's words to condemn the Christian
feasts more than the Judaical.<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a> Conradus

days, either he condemneth the observing
of their days <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">materialiter</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">formaliter,
i.e.</span></span> either he condemneth the observation
of the same feasts which the Jews
observed, or the observing of them with
such a meaning, after such a manner, and
for such an end as the Jews did. The former
our opposites dare not hold, for then
they should grant that he condemneth their
own Easter and Pentecost, because these
two feasts were observed by the Jews. Nor
yet can they hold them at the latter, for he
condemneth that observation of days which
had crept into the church of Galatia, which
was not Jewish nor typical, seeing the Galatians,
believing that Christ was already
come, could not keep them as figures of his
coming as the Jews did, but rather as memorials
that he was already come, saith
Cartwright.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a>
1. If the Apostle's reasons
wherewith he impugns the observation of
days, hold good against our holidays so well
as against the Jewish or popish days, then
doth he condemn those, no less these. But
the Apostle's reasons agree to our holidays
for, 1. According to that reason, Gal. iv.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-036">[pg 1-036]</span><a name="Pg1-036" id="Pg1-036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3, they bring us under a yoke of bondage.
Augustine,<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a>
complaining of some ceremonies
wherewith the church in his time was burdened,
thought it altogether best that they
should be cut off, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etiamsi fidei non videantur
adversari, quia religionem quam
Christus liberam esse voluit, servilibus oneribus
premunt.</span></span> Yea, he thought this yoke
of servitude greater bondage, and less tolerable
than the servility of the Jews, because
they were subject to the burdens of
the law of God, and not to the presumptions
of men. The yoke of bondage of Christians,
in respect of feasts, is heavier than the yoke
of the Jews, not only for the multitude of
them, but because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christianorum festa, ab
hominibus tantum, judaeorum vero a Deo
fuerint instituta</span></span>, saith Hospinian.<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a> Have
not we then reason to exclaim against our
holidays, as a yoke of bondage, heavier than
that of the Jews, for that our holidays are
men's inventions, and so were not theirs?
The other reason, Gal. iv. 9, holdeth as
good against our holidays. They are rudimental
and pedagogical elements, which beseem
not the Christian church, for as touching
that which Tilen objecteth,<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> that many
in the church of the New Testament are
still babes to be fed with milk, it maketh
as much against the Apostle as against us;
for by this reason, he may as well throw
back the Apostle's ground of condemning
holidays among the Galatians, and say, because
many of the Galatians were babes,
therefore they had the more need of those
elements and rudiments. The Apostle, Gal.
iv. 3, compareth the church of the Old Testament
to an infant, and insinuateth, that in
the days of the New Testament the infancy
of the church hath taken an end. And
whereas it might be objected, that in the
church of the New Testament there are
many babes, and that the Apostle himself
speaketh of the Corinthians and Hebrews as
babes: it is answered by Pareus,<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non de
paucis personis, sed de statu totius ecclesiae
intelligendum est quod hic dicitur.</span></span> There
were also some in the church of the Old
Testament, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">adulti fide heroes</span></span>; but in respect
of the state of the whole church, he
who is least in the kingdom of God, is greater
than John Baptist, Luke vii. 28. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lex</span></span>,
saith Beza, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vocatur elementa, quia illis velut
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-037">[pg 1-037]</span><a name="Pg1-037" id="Pg1-037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">

taken from the opposition of the shadow and
the body, Col. ii. 17, doth militate against
our holidays; for the Apostle there speaketh
in the present time, ἐστι σκια: whereas
the Judaical rites were abolished, whereupon
Zanchius noteth,<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> that the Apostle doth not
so much speak of things by-past, as of the
very nature of all rites, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Definiens ergo ipsos
ritus in sese, dixit eos nil aliud esse
quam umbram</span></span>. If all rites, then our holidays
among the rest, serve only to adumbrate
and shadow forth something, and by
consequence are unprofitable and idle, when
the substance itself is clearly set before us.
4. That reason, Col. ii. 20, doth no less irresistibly
infringe the ordinances about our
holidays than about the Jewish; for if men's
ordinances, about things once appointed by
God himself, ought not to be obeyed, how
much less should the precepts of men be received
about such things in religion as never
had this honour to be God's ordinances, when
their mere authority doth limit or adstrict
us in things which God hath made lawful
or free to us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect</span></span>. 4. Thus we see how the Apostle's
reasons hold good against our holidays; let
us see next what respects of difference the
Bishop can imagine to evidence wherefore
the Judaical days may be thought condemned
by the Apostle, and not ours. He deviseth a
double respect; and first he tells us,<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> that
the Jewish observation of days was to a typical
use. And whereas it is objected by us,
that the converted Jews did not observe
them as shadows of things to come, because
then they had denied Christ, he answereth
thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Howbeit the converted Jews did not
observe the Jewish days as shadows of things
to come, yet they might have observed
them as memorials of by-past temporal and
typical benefits, and for present temporal
blessings, as the benefit of their delivery out
of Egypt, and of the fruits of the earth,
which use was also typical.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. This
is his own conjecture only, therefore he
himself propoundeth it doubtfully, for he
dare not say, they did observe them as memorials,
&amp;c., but, they might have observed,
to which guessing, if I reply, they might
also not have observed them as memorials
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-038">[pg 1-038]</span><a name="Pg1-038" id="Pg1-038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of those by-past or present benefits, we say
as much against him, and as truly, as he
hath said against us. 2. His form of reasoning
is very uncouth, for, to prove that
the observation of days by the converted
Jews was to a typical use, he allegeth, that
they might have observed, &amp;c. Thus proving
a position by a supposition. O brave! 3.
There is no sense in his conjecture, for he
yields that they did not observe those days
as shadows of things to come, and yet he
saith, they might have observed them as
memorials of by-past typical benefits; now
they could not observe those days as memorials
of types, except they observed them also
as shadowing forth the antitypes. Pentecost,
saith Davenant,<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et illa legis datae celebratio.
Spiritus Sancti missionem, et legis
in tabulis cordium per eundem Spiritum
inscriptionem, adumbravit. Scenopegiae
festum peregrinationem hominis pii per
hoc mundi desertum ad caelestem patriam
delineabat, &amp;c.</span></span> So that the feast of
Pentecost, if it had been observed as a memorial
of the promulgation of the law, could
not but shadow forth the sending of the
Holy Spirit into our hearts, to write the law
in them. And the feast of tabernacles, if it
had been observed as a memorial of the
benefits which God bestowed on his people
in the wilderness, could not but shadow out
God's conducting of his children, through
the course of their pilgrimage in this world,
to the heavenly Canaan. 4. If feasts which
were memorials of temporal benefits, were
for this reason mystical, then he must grant
against himself, that much more are our
feasts mystical, which are memorials of spiritual
benefits, and consecrated to be holy
signs and symbols, for making us call to
mind the mysteries of our redemption. 5.
Before this dispute take an end, we shall see
out of the best learned among our opposites,
that they observe the holidays as mystical,<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a>
and more mystical than the Bishop here describeth
the Jewish days to have been, and
so we shall see the falsehood of that pretence,
that they are observed only for order
and policy, and not for mystery. 6. If we
would know the true reason which made
the converted Jews to observe those days, it
was not any mystical use, but that which made
them think themselves obliged to other Mosaical
rites; even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propter auctoritatem legis</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-039">[pg 1-039]</span><a name="Pg1-039" id="Pg1-039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saith Junius;<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> for albeit they could not
be ignorant, that these rites were shadows
of things to come, and that the body was of
Christ, in whom, and in the virtue of whose
death they did stablish their faith, yet they
did not at first understand how such things
as were once appointed by God himself, and
given to his people as ordinances to be kept
by him throughout their generations, could
be altogether abolished, and for this cause,
though they did condescend to a change of
the use and signification of those ceremonies,
as being no more typical of the kingdom of
Christ, which they believed to be already
come, yet still they held themselves bound
to the use of the things themselves as things
commanded by God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus much may be collected from Acts
xv. 21, where James gives a reason wherefore
it was expedient that the Gentiles should
observe some of the Jewish rites for a time,
as Calvin,<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>
Beza,<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> and
Junius,<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> expound the
place. His reason is, because the Jews, being
so long accustomed with the hearing of
the law of Moses, and such as did preach
the same, could not be made at first to understand
how the ordinances which God
gave to his people by the hand of Moses,
might be cast off and not regarded, which
importeth as much as I say, namely, that
the reason wherefore the converted Jews
were so apt to be scandalised by such as
cared not for the ceremonial law, and held
themselves obliged to observe the same, was
because they saw not how they could be exempted
from the ordinances and statutes of
the law of Moses, with which they had been
educated and accustomed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. Rests the second respect of difference
given by the Bishop: <span class="tei tei-q">“Further
(saith he), they did observe them with opinion
of necessity, as things instituted by
God for his worship and their salvation,
which sort of observation was legal.”</span><a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>
1. Be it so; he cannot hereupon infer, that
the Apostle doth only condemn the observation
of Judaical days, for he seeth nothing
of observing days with opinion of necessity,
but simply and absolutely he condemneth
the observing of days, and his reasons reflex
on our holidays, as well as the Jewish. 2.
Their opinion of necessity he either refers to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-040">[pg 1-040]</span><a name="Pg1-040" id="Pg1-040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the institution which these days once had
from God, or else to the use which, at that
time, they had for God's worship and their
salvation. That they observed them with
opinion of necessity, as things which had
been instituted by God, it is most likely,
but that they observed them with opinion of
necessity, as things necessary for God's worship
and their salvation, is more than can
be made good, it is more probable that
they observed them merely and simply for
that they had the honour to be instituted by
God in his law. For to say that they observed
them to the same use and end for
which God did institute them, is false, because
then they had observed them as types
and shadows of the coming of Christ, and so
had denied Christ. 3. If the Apostle condemn
the observing of days instituted by
God, with opinion of necessity, much more
doth he condemn the observing of days instituted
by men with such an opinion. And
such is the observation of days urged upon
us. Though the Bishop pretend that the
observing of our holidays is not imposed with
opinion of necessity, shall we therefore think
it is so? Nay, Papists do also pretend that
the observation of their ceremonies is not
necessary,<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a> nor the neglecting of them a
mortal sin. I have proved heretofore, out
of their opposites' own words, that the ceremonies
in question (and, by consequence,
holidays among the rest) are urged upon us
with opinion of necessity, and as their words,
so their works bewray them, for they urge
the ceremonies with so exorbitant vehemency,
and punish refusers with so excessive severity,
as if they were the weightiest matters
of the law of God. Yet they would
have us believe, that they have but sober
and mean thoughts of these matters, as of
circumstances determined for order and policy
only. Just like a man who casts firebrands
and arrows, and yet saith, Am not
I in sport? Prov. xvi. 18, 19. They will
tell us that they urge not the ceremonies as
necessary in themselves, but only as necessary
in respect of the church's determination,
and because of the necessity of obeying
those who are set over us. But, I pray, is
not this as much as the Rhemists say,<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> who
place the necessity of their rites and observances,
not in the nature of the things themselves,
but in the church's precept?

unanswerable reasons that holidays, as now
urged upon us, take away our Christian liberty,
I will now pull off them the coat of
some fig leaves wherewith they are trimmed
up. And first, I hope it will appear to how
small purpose Dr Davenant would conciliate
his reader's mind<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> to allow of the
church's ordinances about holidays (peradventure because
he saw all that he had said of that purpose
to be too invalid proof), by six cautions,
whereby all superstition and abuse which
may ensue upon them may be shunned.
For whatsoever doth manifestly endanger
men's souls, being a thing not necessary in
itself, at which they take occasion of superstitious
abuse, should rather be removed altogether
out of the way, than be set about
with a weak and easily-penetrable hedge of
some equivocative cautions, which the ruder
sort do always, and the learned do too oft,
either not understand or not remember.
Now, Bishop Lindsey confesseth,<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> and puts
it out of all doubt, that when the set times
of these solemnities return, superstitious conceits
are most pregnant in the heads of people;
therefore it must be the safest course to
banish those days out of the church, since
there is so great hazard, and no necessity, of
retaining them.

men to the observation of holidays. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observandum

that they were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro varietate regionum

that the Asiatican doctors did not care
much for this constitution of Pius. I conclude
with Cartwright,<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> that those feasts
of the primitive church <span class="tei tei-q">“came by custom,
and not by commandment, by the free choice
of men, and not by constraint.”</span> So that
from these, no commendation ariseth to our
feasts, which are not only established by
laws, but also imposed with such necessity
and constraint, as spoileth us of our liberty.

2. The festival days observed by the ancient
church, were not accounted more excellent
than other days, for, saith Jerome,<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Moreover, the proctors for holidays
among us think to make advantage of
the practice of other reformed churches, and
the judgment of modern divines. But we
are to consider, 1. As they have the example
of some churches for them, so we have
the example of other churches for us, for
the church of Geneva in Savoy, and the
church of Strasburg in Germany, did abolish
festival days, as Calvin writeth.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a> Yea,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in hac tota provincia aboliti fuerunt dies

Helvetia did also banish them all away, as
Bullinger writeth to Calvin.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> 2. The practice
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-043">[pg 1-043]</span><a name="Pg1-043" id="Pg1-043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the greatest part of the reformed
churches in observing holidays, cannot commend
them in the church of Scotland, 1.
Because she did spue them out with so great
detestation, that she is more bound to abhor
them than other churches which did not
the like, and I may well apply to them that
which Calvin saith<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> of the ceremonies of the
Interim, to Valentinus Pacaeus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ut concedam
faetidas illas sordes quibus purgatae
fuerunt vestrae ecclesiae, inrebus medus
posse censeri: earum tamen restitutio eritne
res media?</span></span> 2. The church of Scotland is
tied yet with another bond to hate holidays,
of which other churches are free; for, by a
solemn oath sworn to the God of heaven,
she hath abjured all antichristian and popish
rites, and dedicating of days particularly.
When Tilen would make answer to this argument,
he saith,<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> that men's consciences
should not be snared with rash oaths and
superstitious vows, and if that such bonds be
laid on, they should be broken and shaken
off. What! Calls he this a superstitious
vow, which abjured all superstition and superstitious
rites? Or calls he this a rash
oath, which, upon so sage and due deliberation,
so serious advisement, so pious intention,
so decent preparation, so great humiliation,
was religiously, publicly, solemnly sworn
throughout this land, and that at the straight
command of authority? Who is ignorant
of these things, except he be a stranger in
our Israel? But say the oath had been
rash and temeratious, shall it not therefore
oblige? His judgment is, it doth not; and
so thinks the Bishop of Winchester,<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> who
teacheth us, that if the oath be made rashly,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">paenitenda promissio non perficienda
praesumptio</span></span>, he had said better thus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">paenitenda
praesumptio, perficienda promissio</span></span>;
for was not that a very rash oath which the
princes of Israel did swear to the Gibeonites,
not asking counsel at the mouth of the Lord?
Josh. ix. 14-16, yet it bound both them,
Josh ix. 19, and their posterity, some hundred
years after, 2 Sam. xxi. 1. If the
matter then be lawful, the oath binds, were
it sworn ever so rashly.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. As touching the judgment of
divines, we say, 1. Many divines disallow of
festival days, and with the church, were free
of them. For the Belgic churches, in their
synod, anno 1578, wished that the six days
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-044">[pg 1-044]</span><a name="Pg1-044" id="Pg1-044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
might be wrought upon, and that the Lord's
day alone might be celebrated. And Luther
in his book, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Bonis Operibus</span></span>, wished
that there were no feast-days among
Christians but the Lord's day. This wish
of theirs declareth plainly, that they allowed
of no holiday except the Lord's day; yet
Bishop Lindsey must make a fashion of saying
something for an answer. <span class="tei tei-q">“This wish
(saith he<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a>) Luther and the Belgic churches
conceived, out of their miscontent at the
number, corruptions, and superstitions of the
festival days, beside the Lord's day, as ye
do.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Their wish importeth a simple
and absolute mistaking of all festival
days besides the Lord's day, and not of
their number and corruptions only. 2. It
is well that he acknowledgeth both them and
us to have reason of miscontentment at holidays,
from their corruptions and superstitions.
The old Waldenses also,<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> whose doctrine
was restored and propagated by John
Huss, and Jerome of Prague, after Wiclif,
and that with the congratulation of the
church of Constantinople, held,<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> that they
were to rest from labour upon no day but
upon the Lord's day, whereby it appeareth,
that holidays have had adversaries before us.
I find that they pervert some places which
they allege against us out of Calvin. Tilen
allegeth,<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Calvin. Inst.</span></span>, lib. 2, cap. 8, sec. 32,
acknowledging <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alios quoque dies festos praeter
dominicum</span></span>, &amp;c. I marvel how a judicious
reader could imagine such a thing to be
in that place, for both in that and the subsequent
section, he is speaking of the Lord's
day against the Anabaptists, and if any man
will think that in sec. 32 he is speaking of
holy assemblies of Christians in the general,
yet he can see nothing there of any festival
days, beside the Lord's day, dedicated to
holy meetings. There is another place of
Calvin abused by Bishop Spotswood<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> and
Bishop Lindsey,<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> taken out of one of his
Epistles to Hallerus, which I find in the
volume before quoted, p. 136, 137, that
which they grip to in this epistle is, that
Calvin, speaking of the abrogation of festival
days in Geneva, saith, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hoc tamen testatum
esse volo, si mihi delata optio fuisset,
quod nunc constitutum est, non fuisse pro
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-045">[pg 1-045]</span><a name="Pg1-045" id="Pg1-045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
sententia dicturum. Ans.</span></span> That which made
Calvin say so, was not any liking which he
had to festival days, for he calls the abolishing
of them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ordo bene compositus</span></span>;<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> but as
himself showeth in the following epistle,
which beareth this title, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cal. Ministro Burensi,
S.D.</span></span>, the reason why he durst scarcely
have so determined, if his judgment had
been required, was, because, he saw neither
end nor remedy for the prevailing tumult of
contention raised about festival days, and
likely to impede the course of reformation;
therefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fovendae pacis studio</span></span>, he professeth
that he durst not make mention of the
abrogation of those holidays. Because he
would have tolerated holidays, because he
durst not at that time, and as the case then
stood, have spoken of the abolishing them,
can it be hereupon concluded that he allowed
of them? No, sure. But it is observable
how both those prelates pervert
Calvin's words. Bishop Spotswood allegeth
his words anent the abolishing of these festival
days, thus: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego neque suasor neque
impulsor fui, atque hoc testatum volo, si
mihi delata optio</span></span>, &amp;c. Whereas the words
in that epistle lie thus: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego tametsi neque
suasor, neque impulsor fui, sic tamen accidisse
non moleste fero. Quod si statum
nostrae ecclesiae aeque compertum haberes,
non dubitares meo judicio subscribere.
Hoc tamen testatum esse volo, si
mihi delata optio</span></span>, &amp;c. The Bishop would
have made his hearers believe that Calvin
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was not content with the abolishing of the
festival days</span></em>, whereas his words testify the
very contrary. Bishop Lindsey is as gross
in perverting the end of that epistle. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nec
tamen est cur homines adeo exasperentur,
si libertate nostra ut ecclesiae edificatio
postulat utimur</span></span>, &amp;c., from which words he
concludes, that in Calvin's judgment, the
observation and abrogation of those days
is in the power and liberty of the church.
But the reader will perceive, that Calvin
there speaketh only of the church's liberty
to abrogate holidays, and nothing of her
power to observe them, for he is showing,
that howbeit he durst not have given advice
to abolish them, if the decision had been referred
to him, yet they had no reason for
them who were offended at the abolishing
of them in Geneva, because that church had
done no more than she had power and liberty
to do for edification. 3. Other testimonies
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-046">[pg 1-046]</span><a name="Pg1-046" id="Pg1-046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they produce, which cannot help them
much. That which Bishop Lindsey<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> allegeth
out of Zanchius's confession, maketh him
but small advantage; for though Zanchius
there alloweth of the sanctification of some
festival days, yet, writing on the fourth commandment,
he acknowledgeth that it is more
agreeable to the first institution, and to the
writings of the apostles, that one day of the
week only be sanctified. What meant the
Bishop to say?<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> that this place is falsified and
mutilated by his antagonist, who quotes it
not to prove that Zanchius disalloweth of
festival days, but to prove that, in Zanchius's
judgment, the sanctification of the Sabbath
only, and no other day in the week, agreeth
best with divine and apostolical institution?
Was there any need to allege more of Zanchius's
words than concerned the point which
he had to prove? The Bishop allegeth also
a testimony out of Perkins on Gal. iv. 10,<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>
which makes him but very little help; for
albeit Perkins thought good, in some sort,
to excuse the observing of days in his own
mother church of England, yet I find in
that place, 1. He complaineth that the greatest
part respects those holidays more than
they should. 2. He alloweth only the observing
of days for order's sake, that men
may come to the church to hear God's word,
which respect will not be enough to the Bishop,
if there be not a solemnising and celebrating
of the memory of some of God's inestimable
benefits, and a dedicating of the
day to this end and purpose. 3. He saith,
that it is the privilege of God to appoint an
extraordinary day of rest, so that he permitteth
not power to the church for appointing
a set, constant, and anniversary day of
rest, for such a day becometh an ordinary
day of rest. 4. He preferreth the practice
of those churches of the Protestants who do
not observe holidays, because, saith he, the
church, in the apostles' days, had no holiday
besides the Lord's day, and the fourth commandment
enjoins the labour of six days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. The Bishop meeteth with another
answer in his antagonist which crosseth his
testimonies, namely, that howsoever foreign
divines, in their epistles and councils, spake
sometimes sparingly against holidays, when
their advice was sought of churches newly
risen out of Popery and greatly distressed,
yet they never advised a church to resume
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-047">[pg 1-047]</span><a name="Pg1-047" id="Pg1-047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them where they were removed. The Bishop
objecteth against this answer,<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> that Calvin,
epist. 51, <span class="tei tei-q">“adviseth the Monbelgardens
not to contend against the prince for not resuming
(he should have said, for not receiving,
if he had translated Calvin's words faithfully)
of all festival days, but only such as
served not to edification, and were seen to
be superstitious.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Albeit he spake
sparingly against holidays, when he gave advice
to that distressed and lately reformed
church, lest the work of reformation should
have been letted, yet he did not allow holidays
among them. For in another epistle written
to them he saith,<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De pulsu campanarum
et diebus festis ita sentimus, ferendas
potius esse vobis has ineptias, quam stationem
in qua estis a domino collocati deferendum,
modo ne approbetis; modo etiam
liberum vobis sit reprehendere, quae inde
sequentur superstitiones.</span></span> And this he setteth
down for one of these superstitions, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod
dies a die discernitur</span></span>, where also he condemneth
both the observing of days to the
honour of man as superstitious, and the observing
of them for the honour of God as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-048">[pg 1-048]</span><a name="Pg1-048" id="Pg1-048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Judaical. If holidays, in Calvin's judgment,
be fooleries—if he gave advice not to approve
them—if he thought them occasions
of superstition—if he held it superstition to
distinguish one day from another, or to esteem
one above another—if he call them Judaical,
though kept to the honour of God,
judge then what allowance they had from
him. 2. If the Bishop stand to Calvin's
judgment in that place which he quoteth, he
must allow as to refuse some festival days,
though enjoined by the prince. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In festis
non recipiendis cuperem vos esse constantiores,
sic tamen ut non litigetis de quibuslibet.</span></span>
Then he allowed them to contend
against some holidays, though the prince
imposed them. 3. The church of Scotland
did remove festival days in another manner,
and bound herself never to receive them
by another bond than ever the Monbelgardens
did; so that having other bonds lying
upon us than other churches have, we are so
much the more straightly obliged neither to
receive holidays, nor any other antichristian
and popish ceremony.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-050">[pg 1-050]</span><a name="Pg1-050" id="Pg1-050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should cast their coal to the fire, to entertain
and increase discord, and lest, shunning
one inconveniency, they should draw on a
great. Mr Sprint saith,<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“It may be
granted, that offence and hinderance to edification
do arise from those our ceremonies.”</span><a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a>
He confesseth also, that the best
divines wished them to be abolished, as being
many ways inconvenient; notwithstanding,
he hath written a whole treatise, of the necessity
of conformity in case of deprivation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. But let us understand how he
proveth<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> that sometimes it is expedient and
necessary to conform unto such burdensome
and beggarly ceremonies, as are many ways
inconvenient, and occasions of sundry evil
effects. His principal reason is,<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> That the
apostles, by direction of the Holy Ghost, and
upon reasons of common and perpetual equity,
did practise themselves, and caused others to
practise, yea, advised and enjoined (as matters
good and necessary to be done) ceremonies
so inconvenient and evil in many main and
material respects, as the ceremonies enjoined
and prescribed in the church of England
are supposed to be; whence he would have
it to follow, that to suffer deprivation for refusing
to conform to the ceremonies of the
church of England, is contrary to the doctrine
and practice of the apostles. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>
These Jewish ceremonies in the use and
practice of the apostles, were no way evil
and inconvenient, as himself everywhere
confesseth, whereas, therefore, he tells us,<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a>
that those ceremonies were abused to superstition,
were of mystical signification, imposed
and observed as parts of God's worship,
swerving from the general rules of
God's word, not profitable for order, decency,
and edification, offensive many ways,
and infringing Christian liberty, he runs at
random all the while; for these things agree
not to the Jewish ceremonies, as they were
rightly used by the apostles themselves, and
by others at their advice, but only as they
were superstitiously used with opinion of
necessity by the obstinate Jews, and by the
false teachers, who impugned Christian liberty.
So that all that can follow upon Mr
Sprint's argument is this: That notwithstanding
of the evils and inconveniences
which follow upon certain ceremonies in the
superstitious abuse of them by others, yet if,
in our practice, they have a necessary or expedient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-051">[pg 1-051]</span><a name="Pg1-051" id="Pg1-051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
use, then (after the example of the
apostles) we may well conform unto them.
Now, all this cometh not near the point
which Mr Sprint undertaketh to prove,
namely, that granting the controverted ceremonies
to be, in our use and practice of the
same, many ways evil and inconvenient, yet
to suffer deprivation for refusing to conform
to the same is contrary to the doctrine and
practice of the apostles. And as touching
the comparison instituted betwixt our controverted
ceremonies, and these antiquated
ceremonies of the Jews, practised and prescribed
by the apostles after the ascension
of Christ, and before the full promulgation
of the gospel, many evils there be in ours,
which could not be found in theirs. For,
1. Ours have no necessary use, and might
well be spared; theirs had a necessary use
for avoiding of scandal, Acts xv. 28. 2. Ours
produce manifold inconveniences (whereof
we are to speak hereafter) in over use and
practice of the same, which is prescribed,
theirs in the use and practice of the same,
which was enjoined by the apostles, were
most expedient for winning of the obstinate
Jews, 1 Cor. ix. 20; and for keeping
of the weak, 1 Cor. ix. 22; and for teaching
the right use of Christian liberty to
such as were strong in the faith, both
among the believing Jews and converted
Gentiles, Rom. iv. &amp;c.; 1 Cor. viii.; x.
3. Ours are proved to be, in their nature
unlawful; theirs were (during the foresaid
space) in their nature indifferent, Rom. xiv.
6; Gal. vi. 15. 4. Ours are imposed and
observed as parts of God's worship (which
we will prove afterward);<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a>
theirs not so, for
where read we, that (during the foresaid
space) any holiness was placed in them by
the apostles? 5. Ours have certain mystical
significations; theirs not so: for it is no
where to be read, that the apostles either
practised or prescribed them as significative
resemblances of any mystery of the kingdom
of God. 6. Ours make us (though
unnecessarily) like unto idolaters, in their
idolatrous actions; theirs not so. 7. Ours
are imposed with a necessity both of practice
and opinion, even out of the case of
scandal; theirs not so. 8. Ours are pressed
by naked will and authority; theirs, by
such special grounds of momentaneous reason,
as made the practice of the same necessary
for a certain time, whether the apostles
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-052">[pg 1-052]</span><a name="Pg1-052" id="Pg1-052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had enjoined it or not. 9. Ours are
urged even upon such as, in their consciences,
judge them to be unlawful; theirs not so.
10. Ours have no better original than human
and antichristian invention; theirs had
their original from God's own institution.
11. Ours are the accursed monuments of
popish idolatry, to be ejected with detestation;
theirs were the memorials of Mosaical
policy, to be buried with honour. 12.
Ours are pressed by such pretended reasons,
as make them ever and everywhere necessary;
theirs, by such reasons as did only
conclude a necessity of using them at some
times, and in some places. 13. Ours are
urged after the full promulgation of the gospel
and acknowledgment of Christian liberty;
theirs, before the same. 14. Ours are
urged with the careless neglect of pressing
more necessary duties; theirs not so. These
and other differences betwixt the controverted
and Jewish ceremonies, do so break
the back of Mr Sprint's argument, that
there is no healing of it again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. His second reason whereby he
goeth about to prove the necessity of conforming
to inconvenient ceremonies, in the
case of deprivation, he taketh from this
ground:<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a>
That when two duties commanded
of God, do meet in one practice, so as we
cannot do them both, in this case we must
perform the greater duty, and neglect the
lesser. Now, whereas he saith, when two
duties do meet, &amp;c., he means not, that
both may be duties at once, for then a man
shall be so straitened that he must needs
commit a sin, in that he must needs omit
one of the duties. But (as he explaineth
himself) he calleth them duties, being considered
apart: as, to hear a sermon at the
church on the Sabbath, and to tend a sick
person ready to die at home, at the same
time, both are duties, being considered apart,
but meeting together in our practice
at one time, there is but one duty, because
the lesser work binds not for that present.
Now, he assumes that the doctrine and practice
of suffering deprivation for refusing to
conform to inconvenient ceremonies, doth
cause men to neglect greater duties to perform
the lesser, for proof whereof he enlargeth
a needless discourse, tending to prove
that preaching is a greater duty and of
higher bond than the duty of labouring
unto fit ceremonies, or of refusing inconvenient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-053">[pg 1-053]</span><a name="Pg1-053" id="Pg1-053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ceremonies, which cannot help his
cause. That which he had to prove was,
that not to suffer deprivation for refusing of
inconvenient ceremonies, is a greater duty
than the refusing of inconvenient ceremonies.
But it will be said, that to suffer
deprivation for the refusing of inconvenient
ceremonies, doth cause men to neglect the
preaching of the word, and that is a greater
duty than the refusing of inconvenient ceremonies.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans</span></span> 1. Mr Sprint himself layeth
down one ground, which proveth the refusing
of inconvenient ceremonies to be a greater
duty than the preaching of the word, for
he holdeth<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a>
that the substantials of the second
table do overrule the ceremonials of
the first table, according to that which God
saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will have mercy and not sacrifice,”</span>
Matt. xii. 7. And elsewhere he teacheth,<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a>
that to tend a sick person ready to die is a
greater duty than the hearing of the word.
Now, to practice inconvenient and scandalous
ceremonies, is to commit soul-murder,
and so to break one of the most substantial
duties of the second table. Therefore, according
to Mr Sprint's own ground, the refusing
of inconvenient and scandalous ceremonies
is a greater duty than the preaching
of the word, which is but a ceremonial
of the first table, and if the neglect of
tending a sick person's body be a greater
sin than to omit the hearing of many sermons,
much more to murder the souls of
men, by practising inconvenient and scandalous
ceremonies, is a greater sin than to omit
the preaching of many sermons, which is all
the omission (if there be any) of those who
suffer deprivation for refusing to conform
unto inconvenient ceremonies. But, 2. We
deny that the suffering of deprivation for refusing
to conform unto inconvenient ceremonies,
causeth men to neglect or omit the
duty of preaching. Neither hath Mr Sprint
alleged anything for proof hereof, except
that this duty of preaching cannot be done
with us ordinarily, as things do stand, if
ministers do not conform, for, by order,
they are to be deprived of their ministry.
Now, what of all this? For though, by the
oppressing power of proud prelates, many
are hindered from continuing in preaching,
because of their refusing inconvenient ceremonies,
yet they themselves who suffered
deprivation for this cause cannot be said to
neglect or omit the duty of preaching: most
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-054">[pg 1-054]</span><a name="Pg1-054" id="Pg1-054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gladly would they preach, but are not permitted.
And how can a man be said to
omit or neglect that which he would fain
do but it lieth not in his power to get it
done? All the strength of Mr Sprint's
argument lieth in this: That forasmuch as
ministers are hindered from preaching, if
they do not conform, therefore, their suffering
of deprivation for refusing conformity,
doth cause them neglect the duty of preaching.
Which argument, that I may destroy
it with his own weapons, let us note,<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a> that
he alloweth a man (though not to suffer deprivation,
yet) to suffer any civil penalty or
external loss, for refusing of inconvenient
ceremonies commanded and enjoined by the
magistrate. Now, put the case, that for refusing
inconvenient ceremonies, I be so
fined, spoiled, and oppressed, that I cannot
have sufficient worldly means for myself and
them of my household, hence I argue thus
(if Mr Sprint's argument hold good): That
forasmuch as I am, by strong violence, hindered
from providing for myself and them
of my household, if I do not conform, therefore,
my suffering of those losses for refusing
of conformity, doth cause me to neglect the
duty of providing for myself and for them of
my family, which neglect should make me
worse than an infidel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. Mr Sprint now addeth a third,
proving, that to suffer deprivation for refusing
to conform to the prescribed ceremonies<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a>
(howbeit many ways inconvenient,) is contrary
to the royal law of love, which he labours
to evidence three ways. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, he saith, that
to suffer deprivation for refusing to conform,
doth, by abstaining from a thing in nature
indifferent (such as our ceremonies, saith he,
are proved to be), needlessly deprive men of
the ordinary means of their salvation, which
is the preaching ministry of the word, &amp;c.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. That the controverted ceremonies
are in nature indifferent, neither he, nor
any of his side, hath yet proven; they suppose
that they are indifferent, but they
prove it not. 2. We deny that the suffering
of deprivation for refusing to conform to
the prescribed ceremonies, doth deprive men
of the preaching of the word. Neither saith
Mr Sprint aught for proof hereof but that
which we have already confuted, viz., that
as things do stand, all such as do not conform
are to be deprived, whence it followeth
only, that the injury and violence of prelates
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-055">[pg 1-055]</span><a name="Pg1-055" id="Pg1-055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(not the suffering of deprivation for refusing
to conform) depriveth men of the preaching
of the word. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></span>, he
saith,<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> that the
doctrine and practice of suffering deprivation
for inconvenient ceremonies, condemneth
both the apostolical churches, and all
churches since their times, because there
hath been no church which hath not practised
inconvenient ceremonies. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> It is
most false which he saith of the apostolical
churches; for those Jewish ceremonies practised
by them were most convenient, as we
have said before. And as for other churches
in after ages, so many of them as have practised
inconvenient ceremonies, are not herein
to be followed by us. Better go right
with a few than err with a multitude. Thirdly,
he saith,<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a>
that the suffering of deprivation
for refusing to conform, breedeth and
produceth sundry scandals. First, saith he,
it is the occasion of fraternal discord. O
egregious impudency! who seeth not that
the ceremonies are the incendiary sparkles,
from which the fire of contention hath its
being and burning; so that conforming (not
refusing) is the furnishing of fuel and casting
of faggots to the fire. Secondly, He
allegeth that the suffering of deprivation
for refusing to conform, twofold more scandaliseth
the Papist than conformity; for he
doth far more insult to see a godly minister
thrust out, and with him all the truth of
God pressed, than to see him wear a surplice,
&amp;c. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thirdly</span></span>, he saith, It twofold
more scandaliseth the Atheist, libertine, and
Epicure, who, by the painful minister's deprival,
will triumph to see a door opened for
him without resistance, to live in drunkenness,
whoredom, swearing, &amp;c. Now, for
answer to his second and third pretences,
we say, 1. Mr Sprint implieth indirectly,
that when non-conforming ministers are
thrust out, Papists, Atheists, libertines, and
Epicures, expect but small opposition from
those conforming ministers who come in
their rooms. Our opposites have a skilful
proctor (forsooth) of Mr Sprint. And, indeed,
if Papists and Atheists were so afraid
of Conformists as of Nonconformists, they
would not thus insult. 2. We must distinguish
betwixt deprivation and the suffering
of deprivation. Papists insult indeed,
that their assured friends, the prelates, are
so powerful, as to thrust out from the public
ministry the greatest enemies of Popery.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-056">[pg 1-056]</span><a name="Pg1-056" id="Pg1-056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But as for the ministers' suffering of
themselves to be thrust out, and deprived
for refusing of conformity, it is so far from
giving to Papists any matter of insulting,
that it will rather grieve them and gall them
to the heart, to understand that sundry powerful,
painful, and learned ministers are so
averse from Popery, that before they conform
to any ceremony of the same, they will
suffer for refusal; and that their constancy
and courage, in suffering for such a cause,
will confirm many professors in the persuasion
of the truth of their doctrine, which
they taught against conforming unto popish
ceremonies. But to go on. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourthly</span></span>, saith
he, It twofold more scandaliseth such an
one as doth truly fear the name of God,
who could be more contented to enjoy the
means of his faith and salvation, with a small
inconveniency of some ceremonies which he
grieveth at, than to lose his pastor, the gospel,
and the ordinary means of his faith and
salvation. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Mr Sprint supposeth
that such an one, as for no respect whatsoever
would be contented with the practice
of some inconvenient ceremonies, doth not
truly fear the name of God. And who is
the Puritan now? Is not Mr Sprint, who
standeth in such a huge distance from all
who are of our mind, and so far preferreth
himself and his followers to us as if we did
not truly fear the name of God? Secondly,
He supposeth that, when non-conforming
ministers are thrust out, the ordinary means
of faith and salvation are not dispensed (to
the comfort and contentment of such as truly
fear the name of God) by those conforming
ministers, who are surrogate in their
stead which, how his fellows will take with,
let them look to it. 3. Forasmuch as the
fear of God is to depart from evil, therefore
such an one as doth truly fear the name of
God, in so far as he doth fear the name of
God, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quatenus</span></span>, he is such an one, will
never take well with the practice of inconvenient
ceremonies, which is not a parting
from, but a cleaving unto evil. 4. They
who truly fear the name of God, are indeed
scandalised by the prelates' depriving of
ministers for refusing to conform; but by
the ministers' suffering of deprivation for
this cause, they are not scandalised but
edified. But, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fifthly</span></span>, saith Mr Sprint, it
offendeth the magistrate, by provoking him
(persuaded and resolved as he is) to disgrace
these otherwise well-deserving ministers,
and to strike them with the sword of authority.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-057">[pg 1-057]</span><a name="Pg1-057" id="Pg1-057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Our refusal to conform to inconvenient
ceremonies being a necessary duty,
if the magistrate be provoked therewith,
we are blameless; neither can it any otherwise
provoke him to disgrace those well-deserving
ministers, than Moses' seeking of
liberty for Israel to go and serve God according
to his will, provoked Pharaoh the
more to oppress them; or than Christ's
preaching of the truth, and his abstaining
from the superstitious ceremonies of the
Pharisees, provoked them to disgrace him,
and plot his hurt. Howbeit we are not ignorant
that the magistrate is not provoked
by our refusing to conform, except as it is
misreported, misdeemed, and misconstructed
to him by the false calumnies of our adversaries,
which being so, he is not incited
by our deed, but by theirs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. Now, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sixthly</span></span>, saith Mr Sprint,
it unjustly condemneth the harmony of all true
churches that ever were primitive and reformed,
and all sound teachers of all times
and places, whose universal doctrine it hath
been, that conformity to inconvenient ceremonies
is necessary, in case of deprivation.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> That the ceremonies practised by the
apostles and apostolic churches were not inconvenient,
it hath been already showed;
that since their times, sundry churches, both
ancient and reformed, have practised inconvenient
ceremonies, we deny not: yet Mr
Sprint himself<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a>
will not defend all the practices
of those churches, whose practice he
allegeth against us. But that all sound
teachers, of all times and places, have
taught the necessity of conformity to inconvenient
ceremonies, in case of deprivation,
he neither doth, neither can make
good; it is but a bare and a bold affirmation
to deceive the minds of the simple.
Did not the good old Waldenses,<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a> notwithstanding
of all the hot persecutions raised
against them, constantly refuse to conform
unto any of those ceremonies of the church
of Rome, which they perceived to have no
necessary use in religion, and to occasion superstition
rather than to serve for edification?
And we verily rejoice to be ranked
with those Waldenses, of whom a popish
historiographer speaketh thus:<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a>

to those inconvenient and hurtful ceremonies
of the Interim, urged by the Adiaphorists.
And howsoever they perceived
many great and grievous dangers ensuing
upon their refusing to conform to the same,
yet they constantly refused, and many ministers
suffered deprivation for their refusal.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a>

edification, Christians for no respect must
dare to meddle with it? Do they not stand
so much upon expediency, that this tenet is
received with them: That the negative
precepts of the law, do bind, not only at all
times, but likewise to all times (whereupon
it followeth, that we may never do that
which is inconvenient or scandalous), and
that the affirmative precepts though they
bind at all times, yet not to all times, but
only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quando expedit</span></span>, whereupon it followeth,
that we are never bound to the practice
of any duty commanded in the law of God,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-059">[pg 1-059]</span><a name="Pg1-059" id="Pg1-059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
except only when it is expedient to be done;
but Mr Sprint excepteth against this rule,<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a>
that it is not generally true; for evidence
whereof he allegeth many things, partly
false, partly impertinent, upon which I hold
it not needful here to insist. As for such
examples, objected by him, as carry some
show of making against this rule, which he
dare not admit, I will make some answer
thereto. He saith, that sometimes even
negative precepts have been lawfully violated;
for these precepts were negative,—none
but priests must eat shew-bread, yet
David did lawfully violate it; thou shalt do
no work upon the Sabbath, yet the priests
brake this, and are blameless; let nothing
of God's good creatures be lost, yet Paul
and his company did lawfully cast away their
goods in the ship, to save their lives, &amp;c.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Mr Sprint might easily have understood,
that when divines say, the affirmative
precepts bind at all times, but not to all
times,—the negative precepts both at all
times and to all times, they ever mean,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">specie actionis manente cadem</span></span>; so long as
an action forbidden in a negative precept
ceaseth not to be evil, as long the negative
precept bindeth to all times: whereas even
whilst an action commanded in an affirmative
precept, ceaseth not to be good, yet the
affirmative precept bindeth not to all times.
So that the rule is not crossed by the alleged
examples; for David's eating of the
shew-bread; the priests' labour upon the
Sabbath; and Paul's casting of the goods
into the sea, were not evil, but good actions
(the kind of the action being changed by the
circumstances). In the meantime, the foresaid
rule still crosseth Mr Sprint's tenet;
for he holdeth that even whilst certain ceremonies
remain evil in their use, and cease
not to be scandalous and inconvenient, yet
we are not ever bound to abstain from them,
but may in the case of deprivation practice
them, which directly contradicteth the rule.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. The position therefore which we
maintain against Mr Sprint, and from which
we will not depart the breadth of one nail,
is this, that we can never lawfully conform
(no not in the case of deprivation) unto any
ceremony which is scandalous and inconvenient
in the use of it. For further confirmation
whereof, we say, 1. Every negative
precept of the law of God bindeth to all
times, in such sort, that the action which it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-060">[pg 1-060]</span><a name="Pg1-060" id="Pg1-060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
forbiddeth (so long as it remaineth evil, and
the kind of it is not changed) can never lawfully
be done. Therefore, forasmuch as to
abstain from things scandalous and inconvenient,
is one of the negative precepts of the
law of God, and the ceremonies whereunto
Mr Sprint would have us to conform in the
case of deprivation, are, and remain scandalous
and inconvenient in our practice and
use of them according to his own presupposal;
it followeth, that the use and practice
of the same is altogether unlawful unto us.
2. That which is lawful in the nature of it
is never lawful in the use of it, except only
when it is expedient for edification, as
teacheth the Apostle, 1 Cor. vi. 12; x. 23.
The Corinthians objected that all indifferent
things were lawful. The Apostle addeth
a limitation,<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">esse licita quatenus conducunt</span></span>,
they are lawful to be used in so far
as they are expedient. 3. It is the Apostle's
commandment, let all things be done
unto edifying, 1 Cor. xiv. 26. Therefore
whatsoever is not done unto edifying ought
not to be done. 4. The Apostle saith, 1
Cor. viii. 13, <span class="tei tei-q">“If meat make my brother to
offend, I will eat no flesh while the world
standeth.”</span> Now, put the case, the Apostle
had been hindered from preaching the gospel
for his precise abstaining from those
meats whereat his brother would be offended,
would he in that case have eaten?
Nay, he saith peremptorily, that whilst the
world standeth he would not eat. 5. Say
not our writers,<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> that we must flee and abstain
from every thing which is not expedient
for the edification of our brother? And
doth not the Bishop of Winchester teach,<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a> that in our going out,
and coming in, and in all our actions, we must
look to the rule of expediency? And saith not Bishop
Spotswood,<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is not to be denied, but they are
ceremonies, which for the inconveniency they
bring, ought to be resisted?”</span> 6. Dare Mr
Sprint deny that which Ames saith he heard
once defended in Cambridge,<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> viz., that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quicquid
non expedit, quatenus non expedit,
non licet</span></span>: Whatsoever is not expedient, in
so far as it is not expedient, it is not lawful.
Doth not Pareus likewise show out of Augustine,<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a>
that such things as are not expedient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-061">[pg 1-061]</span><a name="Pg1-061" id="Pg1-061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but scandalous, and do not edify but
hurt our brother, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fiunt ex accidenti illicita
et peccata, proinde vitanda</span></span>? 7. To conform
unto inconvenient and scandalous ceremonies,
in the case of deprivation, is at the
best, to do evil that good may come of it;
which was the pretence of those councillors
of Pope Pius V. who advised him to suffer
stews at Rome, for preventing a greater evil
of abusing chaste women and honest matrons.
So the pseudo-Nicodemites allege
for their abstaining from flesh upon the days
forbidden by the church, that this they do for
shunning a greater evil, which is the scandal
of Papists. Our divines answer them,<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a> that
evil ought not to be done that good may come
of it. But, saith Mr Sprint,<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> this rule of
the Apostle (Rom. iii. 8) must be limited,<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a>
and in some cases holdeth not; for a man
may, for doing of good, do that which is evil
in use, circumstance, and by accident, so it
be not simply and in nature evil. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
He begs the thing in question, for that rule
is alleged against him to prove that nothing
which is evil in the use of it may be done
for any good whatsoever. 2. The difference
betwixt that which is simply evil, and that
which is evil in use and by accident, is in
that the one may never be done, the other
is unlawful only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro tempore</span></span>; but in this
they agree, that both are unlawful; for that
which is evil by accident,<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a> whilst it is such,
is unlawful to be done, no less than that
which is in nature evil. 3. Divines hold
absolutely,<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inter duo vel plura mala
culpæ</span></span> (such as things scandalous and inconvenient)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nullum est eligendum</span></span>; that though
in evils of punishment we may choose a lesser
to shun a greater, yet in evils of fault,
election hath no place, neither may we do a
lesser fault to shun a greater,<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nec ullum
admittendum malum, ut eveniat aliquod bonum,
sive per se sive per accidens</span></span>. But let
us hear what Mr Sprint can say to the contrary.
He allegeth, the priests' breaking of
the Sabbath, David's eating of the shewbread,
and the apostles' practising of very
hurtful ceremonies; all which things being
unlawful were done lawfully, to further
greater duties.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have answered already, that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-062">[pg 1-062]</span><a name="Pg1-062" id="Pg1-062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
priests' killing of the sacrifices on the Sabbath,
and David's eating of the shew-bread,
were not unlawful, because the circumstances
changed the kind of the actions. Also, that
the Jewish ceremonies used by the apostles
were in their practice no way hurtful, but
very profitable. Mr Sprint allegeth another
example out of 2 Chron. xxx. 18-21:
To perform God's worship not as it was
written, was a sin, saith he, yet to further
God's substantial worships, which was a good
thing, was not regarded of God. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> One
cannot guess from his words how he thought
here to frame an argument, which might
conclude the lawfulness of doing some evil,
that some good may come of it. Howsoever,
that we may have some light in this matter,
let us distinguish betwixt these two things:
1. The people's legal uncleanness, when they
came to eat the passover. 2. Their adventuring
to eat it, notwithstanding their uncleanness.
That they were at that time unclean,
it was a sin. But whilst they prepared
their hearts truly to seek God, and
repented of their uncleanness; that in this
case they adventured to eat the passover,
was no sin, because it is the will of God,
that such as prepare their hearts unfeignedly
to seek him, lament their wants, and repent
for that they are not so prepared and sanctified
for his worship as they ought (there
being no other thing to hold them back beside
some defect of sanctity in themselves),
notwithstanding of any defect which is in
them, draw near to him in the use of his
holy ordinances. As touching the former,
no man will say, that they chose to be unclean,
that they might further God's worship.
But as for the latter, repenting of
their uncleanness, they chose to keep the passover,
this did they to further God's worship,
and this was no sin, especially if we observe
with Tremellius, that it is said, ver. 20, the
Lord healed the people, that is, by the virtue
of his Spirit purified and cleansed them,
so that, that which was lame was not turned
out of the way, but rather made straight
and healed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. And now we leave Mr Sprint,
who hath not only conformed to the controverted
ceremonies, even upon presupposal of
their inconveniency, but hath also made it
very questionable,<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>
whether in the case of
deprivation he ought to conform to sundry
other popish ceremonies, such as shaven
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-063">[pg 1-063]</span><a name="Pg1-063" id="Pg1-063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
crown, holy water, cream, spittle, salt, and
I know not how many more which he comprehendeth
under &amp;c., all his pretences of
greater inconveniences following upon not
conforming than do upon conforming, we
have hitherto examined. Yet what saith
Bishop Spotswood<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> to the cause? He also
allegeth there is a great inconveniency in
the refusing of the ceremonies, namely, the
offending of the king. But for answer unto
this, look what the largest extent of the
prince's power and privilege in matters belonging
unto God's worship, which either
God's word or the judgment of sound divines
doth allow to him, none shall be found
more willingly obsequious to his commandments
than we. But as touching these ceremonies
in question, we are upon evident
grounds persuaded in our consciences, that
they are both unlawful, and inexpedient for
our church, and though they were lawful in
themselves, yet we may answer as the oppugners
of the Interim replied to those who
urged yielding to the ceremonies of the
same,<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> surplice, holidays, tapers, &amp;c., because
of the emperor's commandment. That
the question is not about things indifferent,
but about a main article of faith, namely,
Christian liberty, which admitteth not any
yoke to be imposed upon the conscience, no
not in things indifferent. Our gracious
prince who now, by the blessing of God, happily
reigns over us, will not (we assure ourselves)
be offended at us, for having regard
to our consciences, God's own deputies
placed in our souls, so far, that for all the
world we dare not hazard their peace and
quiet, by doing anything with their repugnance
and aversation. Wherefore, we are
more than confident that his Majesty will
graciously accept from us such a reasonable
apology, as they of Strasburg used to
Charles V.<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quantum omnino fieri potest,

that the Defender of the Faith will

than can abide the proof of reason, which
the induction of some particulars shall demonstrate.

is as well seen to without the surplice.
If a man having a black gown upon
him be seen exercising the function of a
minister, it is very strange if any man
think it not sufficiently distinguished from
laics. The Act of Perth, anent confirmation
and bishoping of children, would make it
appear, that this ceremony is most profitable
to cause young children in their tender years

might attend the discharging of this duty;
why should it be made their peculiar? Is
not the parish minister able to catechise
them? Or, 3. If it must depend upon prelates,
and wait upon their leisure; what
hath imposition of hands ado with catechising?
4. How comes it, that children who

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Bishop Lindsey thinks yet to let us
see a greater expediency for observing holidays.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly (saith he)<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> nothing is so
powerful to abolish profaneness, and to root
out superstition out of men's hearts, as the
exercise of divine worship, in preaching,
praying and thanksgiving, chiefly then when
the superstitious conceits of merit and necessity
are most pregnant in the heads of people,—as
doubtless they are when the set
times of solemnities return,—for then it is
meet to lance the aposteme when it is ripe.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> This is a very bad cure; and is not
only to heal the wound of the people slightly,
but to make it the more inveterate and festered.
I might object, that little or nothing
is preached or spoken by him and his
companions at the revolution of those festivities
against the superstitious keeping of them;
but though they should speak as much as can

in word only, and not in deed, the recidivation
will prove worse than the disease. The
best lancing of the aposteme were not to observe
them at all, or to preach against them,
which are tried to work this effect more
powerfully than the Bishop's cure hath
done; for all know that there is none so
free of this superstition as those who observe

the expediency of giving the communion to
the sick in private houses, because he thinks
they should not want this mean of comfort,
as if the wanting of the sacramental signs,
not procured by a man's own negligence or

the Holy Spirit. Nay, it is not so. We

believe that more reverence ariseth to the

as do kneel. I hope it is not unknown how
humbly and reverently many sincere Christians,
with fear and trembling, do address
themselves to that most holy sacrament,
who yet for all the world would not kneel in
receiving it. Thus we see that these expediences,
pretended for the ceremonies, are
attained unto as well and better without
them than by them. But I will go forward
to show some particular inconveniences
found in them.

estate of the churches in Germany, when
Charles V. caused the book called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Interim</span></span>
to be published:<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a> expediency then was pretended
of settling the peace of Germany by
this as the best way; but it produced a very
great inconveniency, and instead of effectuating
peace, it brought forth a hotter contention,
as well between the Protestants
themselves, as between them and Papists.
Expediency is now no less pretended for the
ceremonies, yet no more truly. But before
the bad effects of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Interim</span></span> were seen, the
wiser sort of Protestants<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> wrote against it,
and warned men, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut ab eo tanquam a praesentissima
peste sibi caverent</span></span>. Notwithstanding
that the emperor did straitly inhibit
all impugning of it. And Sleidane
tells us,<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> the reason which made them so
mistake it was, because they thought such
as were upon that course, were opening a
way to the popish religion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per adiaphora
seu res medias</span></span>, and because<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> they wished to
retain the saving doctrine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">puram et salvam
a technis illorum, qui nunc dum ceremonias
restaurare videri volunt, colluviem
totam doctrinae pontificiae rursus introducunt</span></span>.
The like reason have we to mistake
conformity with antichrist in these ceremonies
which are obtruded upon our church,
for may we not justly fear that hereby we
shall be drawn on to conform with him also
in dogmatical and fundamental points of
faith. Nay, what talk I of fear? We have
already seen this bad consequence in a great
part, for it is well enough known how many
heterodox doctrines are maintained by Formalists,
who are most zealous for the ceremonies
anent universal grace, free-will, perseverance,
justification, images, antichrist,
the church of Rome, penance, Christ's passion
and descending into hell, necessity of
the sacraments, apocrypha books, Christ's
presence in the eucharist, assurance of salvation,
&amp;c. Their errors about those heads
we will demonstrate, if need be, to such as
doubt of their mind. In the meantime it
hath been preached from pulpits among
ourselves, that Christ died for all alike,
that the faithful may fall away from grace,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-068">[pg 1-068]</span><a name="Pg1-068" id="Pg1-068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that justification is a successive action,
that none can be assured of salvation in this
life, that images in churches are not to be
condemned, that Christ descended locally
unto the place of the damned, that the
Pope is not antichrist, that Rome is not
Babylon the whore, that the government
and discipline of the church must alter like
the French fashion, at the will of superiors,
that we should not run so far away from
Papists, but come as near to them as we can,
that abstinence and alms are satisfactions
or compensations for sin. These, and sundry
such like tenets, have not been spoken
in a corner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. How far conformity to the ceremonies
of the church of Rome hath drawn
Conformists, of greatest note, to conform to
her faith also, I may give instance in the
Archbishop of Spalato.<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> He holds, that
many rites of the Roman church are ancient
and approvable, that others, though
neither ancient nor universal, yet, because
of custom, should be tolerated, and that
few only are either to be abolished, or, by
some prudent and easy way, purged and refined.
Now, will we know how far this
unity in ceremonies drew him to unity in
substance, then let us hear what is his verdict
of Protestants as well as of Papists, who
suffer for their religion.<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a>

He tells us,<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> moreover, that if the Protestants
will not have peace with those whom
they call Papists, and communicate with
them, then are they schismatics, and are not
in the true church. And in the declaration
of the motives whereupon he undertook his
departure out of the territory of Venice, he
expresseth his judgment of such books as
are framed against the doctrine of the
church of Rome, that he held them above
measure detestable. Neither doth he stand
alone in this pitch, for among the sect of
Formalists, is swarming a sect of Reconcilers,
who preach and profess unity with
the church of Rome in matters of faith.
For example, they say, that that which the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-069">[pg 1-069]</span><a name="Pg1-069" id="Pg1-069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
learned Papists hold concerning justification,
is orthodox, and therefore they will not contend
against them, except it be for their contending
with us, who do agree with them.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. These Reconcilers are too far on
in the way to Popery already; but if they will
be fully reconciled with Papists, they must
transport themselves altogether into their
tents, because Papists will not come forth to
meet them midway. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Interim</span></span> of Germany
tended to reconciliation, yet the Papists
wrote against it.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a>
Cassander sought this reconciliation, but Bellarmine confuteth
his opinion.<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a>
The Archbishop of Spalato was upon the same course of reconciliation,
but his books were condemned as heretical,
in the decree given at Rome, anno 1616,
by the congregation of cardinals deputed by
Pope Paul V., for the making and renewing
of the index of prohibited books. The
Rhemists tell us,<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a>
that they will avoid not
only our opinions, but our very words which
we use. Our adversaries profess that they
reject some expositions of certain places of
Scripture, against which they have no other
reason but because they are our expositions.
Are their minds so aliened from us? And
must we be altogether drawn overstays to
them? Are they so unwilling to be reconciled
to the prejudice of their errors? And
shall we be so willing to be reconciled with
them to the prejudice of the truth? O
strange and monstrous invention! that would
reconcile Christ with antichrist,—agree the
temple of God and idols,—mix light and
darkness together. He had good reason
for him who objected to the Archbishop of
Spalato,<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a>
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qui ubique est, nusquam est</span></span>;
for instead of reconciling Protestants and
Papists, they make themselves a third party,
and raise more controversy. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">O bellua multorum
capitum!</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. Thus we perceive what prejudice
hath arisen, and yet ariseth to the true and
saving doctrine, by the means of symbolising
with the church of Rome in these ceremonies.
But because some Formalists approve
not of this course of reconciliation,
they (I know) would purge the ceremonies
of the blame of it. I will therefore show,
that Reconcilers are set forward in their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-070">[pg 1-070]</span><a name="Pg1-070" id="Pg1-070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
course of reconciliation, by means of the
Roman rites remaining in reformed churches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
G. Cassander, in his book <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Officio pii
Viri</span></span>, relates unto us how he was entered
into this course, and conceived this purpose
of reconciliation, and tells, that from his
youthhood, he was most observant of ecclesiastical
ceremonies, yet so, that he abhorred
all superstition. And when he had
read the writers of that age, who promised
some reformation and repurgation of superstitious
worships and absurd opinions, he
saith, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mire illorum institutum placuit:
qui tamen ita superstitiones et abusiones,
quae nonnullis ceremoniis ecclesiasticis admixtae
erant, exosas haberem ut ipsum ecclesiasticam
politiam, quae his ceremoniis
fere constant, non sublatum et eversam,
sed repurgatam et emendatam esse vellum</span></span>.
We see the first thing which induced him
to a reconciliation, was his liking which he
had to popish ceremonies, and their remaining
in protestant churches, and as this
course hath been attempted, so is it also
advanced by the ceremonies, for thereby
people are induced to say, as they said once,
when popish ceremonies did re-enter in Germany.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“We perceive now, that the Pope
is not so black as Luther made him.”</span> And
as for the Reconcilers themselves, may they
not conceive strong hopes to compass their
end? May they not confidently embark in
this business? May they not with great expectation
of prosperous success achieve their
project? When once they have footing
upon our union with Rome in ceremonies
and church policy, they cannot but hereupon
conceive no small animosity to work
out their intended purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do I talk of a chimera, and imagine now
that which is not? Nay, I will really exemplify
that which I say, in that Proteus
and Versipelles, the Archbishop of Spalato,
for, in the narration of the passages which
were betwixt his Majesty and him, collected
by the Bishop of Durham, we find,<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a> that he
thought the procuring of concord betwixt the
church of England and the church of Rome
to be easy. And his reasons were,<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> because
he was verily persuaded, that the Pope would
approve the English liturgy and the public
use of it, as he professed in his colloquy
with the Bishops of London and Durham,
and the Dean of Winchester. And further,<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-071">[pg 1-071]</span><a name="Pg1-071" id="Pg1-071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he told he was of opinion, that the churches
of Rome and of England, excluding Puritans,
were radically one church. This made
him say,<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“I do find here why to commend
this church, as a church abhorring from
Puritanism, reformed with moderation, and
worthy to be received into the communion
of the Catholic church.”</span> In the following
words, he tells, that he could carry something
out of the church of England which
should comfort all them who hate puritan
strictness, and desire the peace of the church
(meaning them who desired the same reconciliation
with himself). What is more
clear, than that the English ceremonies
were that which made him prosecute, and
gave him hope to effectuate a reconciliation
betwixt the church of England and that of
Rome.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. But put the case, that as yet we
had seen no greater evils following upon the
ceremonies, yet must they be acknowledged
to be inconvenient, because they are dangerous
preparatives for many worse things than
we are aware of, and may draw after them sundry
evil consequences which are not feared.
We have heard before from Spotswood, that
novations in a church, even in the smallest
things, are dangerous. Who can then blame
us to shun a danger, and, fearing the worst,
to resist evil beginnings,—to give no place
to the devil,—to crush the viper while it is in
the shell,—to abstain from all appearance of
evil, 1 Thes. v. 22,—and to take the little
ones of Babylon whilst they are young, and
dash their heads against the stones?

It matters not that many will judge us
too precise for doing so. What? Do they
think this preciseness any other than that
which the law of God requireth, even observing
of the commandment of God, without
adding to it, or diminishing from it,
Deut. xii. 32; and keeping the straight path,
without declining to the right hand or the
left? Deut. xxviii. 14; or, do they think us
more precise than Mordecai, who would do
no reverence to Haman, because he was an
Amalekite, Esth. iii. 2, and so not to be
countenanced nor honoured by an Israelite?
Deut. xxv. 19. Are we more precise than
Daniel, who would not close his window
when he was praying, no, not for the king's
edict, knowing, that because he had used to
do so aforetime, his doing otherwise had been
both a denying of his former profession, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-072">[pg 1-072]</span><a name="Pg1-072" id="Pg1-072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an ensnaring of himself by yielding in small
things, to yield in greater, and after an inch
to take an ell? Dan. vi. 10. Are we more
precise than the Apostle Paul who gave no
place to the adversaries of Christian liberty,
no, not for an hour? Gal. ii. 5. Are we
more precise than David, who would not do
so much as take up the names of idols into
his lips, least from speaking of them he
should be led to a liking of them? Psal. xvi.
4; or, may not the sad and doleful examples
of so many and so great abuses and corruptions
which have crept into the church from
so small and scarcely observable originals,
make us loath at our hearts to admit a change
in the policy and discipline of a well constitute
church, and rightly ordered before
the change, and especially in such things as
are not at all necessary?

In that they obscure the substance of religion,
and weaken the life of godliness by
outward glory and splendour, which draws
away the minds of people so far after it, that
they forget the substance of the service
which they are about. The heathenish

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The policy, then, which in most simple
and single, and least lustred with the pomp
and bravery of ceremonies, cannot but be
most expedient for edification. The king's
daughter is most like herself when she is
all glorious within, not without, Psal. xlv. 13,
and the kingdom of God appeareth best
what it is, when it cometh not with observation,
Luke xvii. 20, 21. But <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition

impediments to the inward and spiritual
worship, because they are fleshly and external.
In the second commandment are forbidden

<span class="tei tei-q">“The kingdom of God is within you,”</span> saith Christ, Luke xvii. 21.
Now, if the Apostle, 1 Tim. iv. 8, say, that
bodily exercise, such as fasting, watching,
&amp;c., which are requisite as helps and furtherances
to the humiliation of the soul, do
but profit a little, then may we say of our
unnecessary and unprofitable ceremonies,
that they are exceedingly nocent and
harmful to true and spiritual worship. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-074">[pg 1-074]</span><a name="Pg1-074" id="Pg1-074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Apostle is not speaking of plays and pastimes,
as Bellarmine would have us to think.
Who can believe that Timothy was so much
addicted to play, that the Apostle had need
to admonish him, that such exercise profiteth
little? He is speaking, then, of such
bodily exercises as in those primitive times
were used religiously, as fasting, watching,
lying on the ground, and such like; and he
would have Timothy rather to exercise himself
to the life and power of godliness, and
to substantial worship, than to any of these
outward things. Neither doth the Apostle
condemn only the superstitious use of these
exercises, as Calvin well observeth,<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alioqui

extenuate and derogate from them, saying,
that they profit little. Therefore (saith he),
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut maxime integer sit animus, et rectus

Paulus quod magnifaciat. Valde

some say? Do we allow of no external

from idolatry and superstition is more
easy to Atheism and the profanation of holy

saith, he could have wished that Beza had

dislike the English ceremonies, condemneth
such rites and circumstances in the external

of this sort. What shall we say then of such

I say not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magnarum</span></span> (as others), but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mirandarum
conjunctionum</span></span>, and record that
at such a time he found out the conjunction
and compatibility of two things which were
ever thought incompatible in former ages,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-075">[pg 1-075]</span><a name="Pg1-075" id="Pg1-075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
namely, rites serving only for decency, and
holy significant ceremonies admonishing men
of their duty in God's worship? Had there
been no moralist (trow we) then to note, that
decency and things serving only for decency,
have place in civility and all moral actions,
in which notwithstanding there is no significant
nor admonitory sacred signs of men's
duty in God's worship? And thus should
these two things be severed, which he hath
conjoined and confounded.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To conclude, we condemn the English
controverted ceremonies which are regarded
as holy and significant, as most inexpedient,
because they derogate from the true inward
and spiritual worship; for man's nature,
saith Camero,<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“is delighted in that which
is fleshly and outward, neglecting that which
is spiritual and inward.”</span> And this is the
reason why least spiritual, lively, and holy
disposition hath followed upon the addition
of unnecessary ceremonies; and why there
was never so much zeal, life, and power of
religion inwardly, in the church of Christ,
as then, when she was freest of ceremonies.
This much<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> a Formalist of great note is forced
to acknowledge. Let us consider, saith
he, <span class="tei tei-q">“the primitive church, flourishing more
in times of the apostles than ever it did
afterwards. Who will not admire her great
simplicity in all points, and especially in
ceremonies? for excepting the celebration of
baptism by washing of water, and of the
holy supper, according to the Lord's institution,
in taking the bread and wine, and distributing
them after thanksgiving; excepting
also the imposition of hands upon those
who extraordinarily received the Holy Ghost,
whether it were in a general calling or a
particular, to a charge in the church, and
availing for a miraculous effect of healing
the sick; I say, these excepted, there will
not be found any other ceremony in those
primitive times, so admirable was their simplicity.”</span>

great hinderance to edification, because they
make much time and pains to be spent about
them, which might be, and (if they were removed)
should be spent more profitably for
godly edifying. That which is said of the
ceremonies which crept into the ancient
church, agreeth well to them.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ista ceremoniarum

Pulpits sound oftentimes with declamations

be employed more profitably.

And, moreover, faithful men whose labours
might be very profitable to the

yoke of ceremonial bondage upon the necks
of God's people. Others who have entered,

Whereby (as he expounds himself)<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> he meant

us receiving and retaining their Roman rites

crooked and perverse nation, that so the

1 Tim. vi. 1. If thus we hold fast

by the same reason yield to some popish
ceremonies for winning of the Papists. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>
1. There is not a like reason of the weak

instructed concerning Christian liberty, and
obstinate Papists who might have been, and
yet may be instructed, but will not. Nor, 2.
Is the same to be done in the bright shining
meridian light of the gospel, which was done
before the full promulgation of the same?
Nor, 3. Is so much honour to be given,<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> and
so great respect to be had to popish and antichristian
rites, as to the ceremonies which
were ordained by God himself. These were
to be suffered awhile, that they might be
honourably buried; to those we are to say
with detestation, <span class="tei tei-q">“Get you hence.”</span> Nor,
4. Can the same things be done at Antioch
which are done at Jerusalem. At Antioch
Peter sinned by using Jewish rites, because
there the greatest part were Gentiles, who
had both heard his preaching and seen his
practice against the ceremonies of the Jews.
But at Jerusalem Paul had to do with the
weak Jews, who had heard little or no
preaching against those ceremonies, and had
seen as little practice contrary unto them.
Now Scotland must not be likened to Jerusalem,
no not to Antioch; for Scotland hath
been filled both with preaching and practice
contrary to the ceremonies of the Papists,
yea, hath moreover spewed them out openly
and solemnly, with a religious and strict oath
never to lick them up again.

vi. 5. Now, as for those in our church who
contend for the ceremonies, many of them
are led by such <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">argumenta inartificialia</span></span>,
as wealth, preferment, &amp;c., and if conscience
be at all looked to by them, yet they only
throw and extort an assent and allowance
from it, when worldly respects have made
them to propend and incline to an anterior
liking of the ceremonies. We do not judge
them when we say so, but by their fruits we
know them. As Pope Innocent VII., while
he was yet a cardinal, used to reprehend the
negligence and timidity of the former popes,
who had not removed the schism and trouble
of the church of Rome, yet when himself was
advanced to the popedom, he followed the
footsteps of his predecessors, governing all
things tumultuously, and making the schism
worse; so among our opposites, not a few
have been overcome with ease, pleasure,
riches, favour, pre-eminence, &amp;c., to like
well of the ceremonies which never had their
first love, when they had both spoken and
disputed against them. What drew them
overstays to contend for them, except (I say
not the seeking of, lest I be thought uncharitable,
but) their being sought by some
worldly benefit? And how could such an
one excuse himself but by Paris's apology,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ingentibus ardent, judicium domis solicitare
meum.</span></span> And what marvel that Balak's
promotion, Num. xxii. 17; and Saul's fields
and vineyards, 1 Sam. xxii. prevail with such
as love this present world, 2 Tim. iv. 10.

side exceeds in contending they are in the
fault, 1 Tim. vi. 4. Now, our opposites do far
overmatch us and overstride us in contention;
for, 1. They harbour an inveterate
dislike of every course and custom which
we like well of, and they carp at many deeds,
words, writings, opinions, fashions, &amp;c. in us,
which they let pass in others of their own
mind. Whereas we (God knows) are glad
to allow in them anything which we allow
in others, and are so far from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nitimur in vetitum,
semper cupimusque negata</span></span>, that most
heartily we condescend to apply ourselves, by
all possible means, to observe them, please
them, and entertain peace with them, who
impose and urge upon us an unconscionable
observation of certain ceremonies, and to do
as much for them as any ground of conscience
or reason can warrant. So far as we have
attained, we walk by the same rule with
them, Phil. iii. 16, and so exceed not in
the measure. 2. It may be seen that they
exceed in contending with us, if we be compared
with the Papists; against them they
contend more remissly, against us more intensively.
Saravia professeth<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> that he thinketh
worse of us than of Papists. He hath reason
who complaineth of Formalists' desire not

their fierceness against their own

exceed, appeareth from the effects of their
contending; hurt and damage is a main
effect of contention. Calvin, Perkins, and
Pareus, observe upon Gal. v. 15, that contentions
breed hurtful and pernicious effects,
which tend to consumption and destruction.
Now, wherein do we injure or harm our opposites
in their persons, callings, places, &amp;c.?
Yet in all these, and many other things, do
they wrong us, by defamation, deprivation,
spoliation, incarceration, &amp;c.? How much
better were it to remove the Babylonian
baggage of antichristian ceremonies, which
are the mischievous means, both of the
strife and of all the evil which ariseth out
of it! Put away the ceremonies, cast out

please him to understand that when we contend
about the removal of the ceremonies,
we content for a very weighty matter; for
we prove the removal of them to be necessary,
in respect of their inconvenience and
unlawfulness. They who urge the ceremonies,
contend for things which are not necessary;
and we who refuse them, contend for
things which are most necessary, even for
the doctrine and discipline warranted by
God's word, against all corruptions of idolatry

can neither be purged of superstition nor
idolatry I have proved in the third part of

be observed, our opposites will be found reprovable,
not we. We contend by the grounds

all objections, and resolve all questions, by
the sentence of superiors and the will of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-085">[pg 1-085]</span><a name="Pg1-085" id="Pg1-085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
law; we contend from God's word and good
reason, they from man's will and no reason.
This was clearly seen at the first conclusion
of the five Articles at Perth Assembly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bishop Lindsey himself, relating the proceedings
of the same, tells us,<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a> that Mr John
Carmichell and Mr William Scot alleged,
that if any would press to abolish the order
which had been long kept in this church,
and draw in things not received yet, they
should be holden to prove either that the
things urged were necessary and expedient
for our church, or the order hitherto kept
not meet to be retained. This was denied,
upon this ground, that it was the prince
(who by himself had power to reform such
things as were amiss in the outward policy
of the church) that required to have the
change made. Well, since they must needs
take the opponent's part, they desired this
question to be reasoned, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether kneeling
or sitting at the communion were the
fitter gesture?”</span> This also was refused,
and the question was propounded thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“His Majesty desires our gesture of sitting
at the communion to be changed into kneeling,
why ought not the same to be done?”</span>
At length, when Mr John Carmichell brought
an argument from the custom and practice
of the church of Scotland, it was answered,<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a>
That albeit the argument held good against
the motions of private men, yet his Majesty
requiring the practice to be changed, matters
behoved to admit a new consideration,
and that because it was the prince's privilege,
&amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I must say, the Bishop was not well advised
to insert this passage, which (if there
were no more) lets the world see that free
reasoning was denied; for his Majesty's authority
did both exeem the affirmers from
the pains of probation (contrary to the laws
of disputation), and state the question, and
also answer arguments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, moreover, when the Articles were
put in voting, the Archbishop, in calling on
the names, did inculcate these and the like
words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Have the king in your mind—remember
on the king—look to the king.”</span>
This Bishop Lindsey passeth over in deep
silence, though it be challenged by his antagonist.
Plinius proveth,<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animalia insecta</span></span>
do sometimes sleep, because sometimes
when light is holden near them, yet they stir
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-086">[pg 1-086]</span><a name="Pg1-086" id="Pg1-086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not. And may not we conclude that the
Bishop was sleeping, when, though both in
this and divers other places, such convincing
light was holden out before them, yet hath he
said nothing, nor stirred himself at all for
the matter? Yet, farther, we find that
Bishop Spotswood, in his sermon at that
pretended Assembly, answereth all such as
cannot yield to the ceremonies with the
peace of their consciences, that without any
more ado, they may not control public judgment,
but must always esteem that to be
best and most seemly which seemeth so in
the eye of public authority,—that even such
rites and orders as are not rightly established
must be obeyed so long as they have the
force of a constitution,—that the sentence of
superiors ought to direct us, and be a sufficient
ground to our conscience for obeying.
This is the best of their reasoning, and before
all fail. The Bishop of Winchester
reasoneth from bare custom.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> Have we not

learn from our Master, that the scandal of
one is to be cared for, much more the scandal
of many, especially if those many be of
the number of the little ones which believe

proceeding in this argument I will premit
these propositions, of which we are to make

Scandal or offence is not the grieving or displeasing
of my brother, for peradventure
when I grieve him or displease him, I do
edify him. Now edification and scandal are
not compatible, but scandal is a word or deed
proceeding from me, which is, or may be, the
occasion of another man's halting, or falling,
or swerving from the straight way of
righteousness. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scandalum</span></span> (saith Jerome<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a>)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2d. This occasion of halting, stumbling, or
swerving, which we call scandal, is some
times only given on the part of the offender,
sometimes only taken on the part of the offended,
sometimes both given on the one
part, and taken on the other. The first
sort is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scandal given and not taken</span></em>, the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3d. All these three kinds of scandal are
sinful. The first is the sin of the offender,
for it is a fault to give my brother occasion
of stumbling, though he stumble not. The
second is the sin of the offended, who should
not take offence where he hath no cause.
The third is a sin on both sides, for as it is
a fault to lay an occasion of falling before
another, so it is a fault in him to fall, though
he have occasion.

he intendeth edification; yet doth he
scandalise them, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ratio et conditio

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5th. An active scandal is given (and so is
faulty) many ways. If it be in a thing lawful,
then it makes our brother condemn our
lawful deed, yea, animates him by our example
to that which in his conscience he condemneth,
both which are sin. If it be in a
thing unlawful, then is the scandal given and
peccant, it, 1. Either our brother be made to
fall into the outward act of sin; or, 2. If he
be made to stumble in his conscience, and to
call in question the way of truth; or, 3. If it
do so much as to make him halt, or weaken
his plerophory or full assurance; or, 4. If it
hinder his growth and going forward, and
make him, though neither to fall, nor to stumble,
nor to halt, yet to have a smaller progress;
or, 5. If none of these evils be produced
in our brother, yet when, either
through our intention and the condition of
the deed together, or through the condition
of the deed alone, occasion is given him of
sinning any one of these ways. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Opus nostrum</span></span>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. 6th. A passive scandal, which
is taken and not given, is not only faulty
when it proceedeth of malice, but also when
it proceedeth of ignorance and infirmity;
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scandalum pusillorum</span></span> may be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scandalum

faulty, as well as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scandalum Pharisaeorum</span></span>.
When weak ones are offended at
me for the use of a lawful thing, before I
know of their weakness, and their taking of
offence, the scandal is only passive; and so
we see that weak ones may take offence
where none is given, as well as the malicious.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-089">[pg 1-089]</span><a name="Pg1-089" id="Pg1-089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Now, their taking of offence, though
it proceed of weakness, yet is sinful; for their
weakness and ignorance is a fault, and doth
not excuse them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7th. A scandal may be at first only passive,
and yet afterward become active. For example,
Gideon's ephod and the brazen serpent
were monuments of God's mercies, and
were neither evil nor appearances of evil;
so that when people were first scandalised by
them the scandal was merely passive, but
the keeping and retaining of them, after that
scandal rose out of them, made the scandal
to become active also, because the reserving
of them after that time was not without appearance
of evil.

which is only passive should be removed, if
it be not some necessary thing, and we are
not only to shun that which giveth scandal,
but also that whereupon followeth a scandal
taken, whatsoever it be, if it be not necessary.
This is so evident, that Papists themselves
subscribe to it; for both Cardinal Cajetan<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9th. Neither can the indifferency or lawfulness
of the thing done, nor the ordinance
of authority commanding the use of it, make
the scandal following upon it to be only passive,
which otherwise, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in case the thing
were neither lawful nor ordained by authority,
should be active. Not the former; for

for is only in necessary things, such as the
hearing of the word, prayer, &amp;c., from which
we may not abstain, though all the world
should be offended at us. In these, I say,
and these only, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scandalum quod oritur ex

12th. We ought, for the scandal of the
malicious, to abstain from all things from
which we ought to abstain for the scandal of
the weak; for we ought not to abstain from
necessary things for the scandal of the weak,
no more than for the scandal of the malicious,
and from things that are not necessary,
we ought to abstain for the scandal of
the malicious as well as for the scandal of
the weak. So that weakness and malice in
the offended <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non variant speciem scandali</span></span>,
but only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gradum ejusdem speciei</span></span>. Both
his fault who is offended through malice, is
greater than his fault who is offended through
weakness, and likewise his fault who offends
the weak in the faith, is greater than his
fault who offends those who are malicious
against the faith, because as we ought to do
good to all men, so chiefly to those of the
household of faith. Nevertheless, the kind
of scandal remains the same, whether we
have to do with the malicious or the weak.

They are, therefore, greatly mistaken,
who conclude from Paul's not circumcising
of Titus, Gal. ii. 4, 5, that he cared not for
the scandal of the malicious. The argument
were good if those false brethren had
been scandalised by his not circumcising of
Titus; but they were only displeased hereby,
not scandalised. The Apostle saw that
they were to be scandalised by his circumcising
of Titus; therefore, of very purpose, he
circumcised him not, because he foresaw <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">statim

tunc per accidens fiunt illicitae.</span></span> Whereupon
I throw back the argument, and prove
from this place, that Paul cared to shun the
scandal of the malicious, which should have
followed upon his circumcising of Titus, as
well as he cared to shun the offence of the
weak, which should have followed upon his
not circumcising of Timothy; and that Paul
cared for the scandal of the malicious is
further confirmed by his not taking wages
at Corinth. They who would have been offended
at his taking wages there were malicious,
and did but seek occasion against him,
2 Cor. xi. 12, yet his taking wages there not
being necessary (as appeareth from 2 Cor.
xi. 9), he abstained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christ's not caring for the scandal of the
Pharisees is also objected, to prove that if
the thing be lawful or indifferent, we are
not to care for the offence of the malicious.
But Parker answereth well:<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The scandal there not cared for is, when the Pharisees
are offended at his abstaining from their
washings and his preaching of true doctrine,—both
of which were necessary duties for
him to do. And when he defendeth his healing
on Sabbaths, Luke xiii. 15, and his disciples'
plucking ears, Matt. xii. 7, upon this
reason they are duties of necessity and charity,
he plainly insinuateth, there is no defence
for deeds unnecessary when the malicious
are scandalised. When the thing was
indifferent, doth he not forego his liberty for
to please them, as when he paid tribute, lest
he should offend them, although he knew
they were malicious?”</span> Matt. xvii. 27.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus have I evinced a main point, namely,
that when scandal is known to follow upon
anything, if it be not necessary, there is no
respect whatsoever which can justify it.

are to be condemned and removed as most
inconvenient. But that the inconveniency
of them, in respect of the scandal which
they cause, may be particularly and plainly
evinced, I come to discuss all the defences
which our opposites use against our argument
of scandal. These Formalists, who
acknowledge the inconveniency of the ceremonies
in respect of scandal, and yet conform
themselves to the same, are brought in
by Hooker<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a>

perish, &amp;c. Our pastoral charge is God's

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. Wherefore I will here meddle
only with such as go about to purge the
ceremonies from the inconveniency of scandal.
And first, they commonly answer us,
that the scandal which followeth upon the
ceremonies is passive and taken only, not
active and given, which answer I find both
impertinent and false. It is impertinent,
because, put the case: the scandal were only
passive and taken, yet the occasion of it
should be removed out of the way when it
is not a thing necessary, according to my
8th, 11th, and 12th propositions; and if any
of our opposites will deny this, let them blush
for shame. A Jesuit shall correct them,<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a>
and teach them from Matt. xvii. 27, that
Christ shunned a scandal which would have
been merely passive, and therefore that this
is not to be taken for a sure and perpetual
rule, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scandalum datum, not acceptum esse
vitandum</span></span>. One of our own writers upon
this same place noteth,<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>
that this scandal which Christ eschewed, had been a scandal
taken only, because the exactors of the tribute-money
ought not to have been ignorant
of Christ's immunity and dignity; yet because
they were ignorant of the same, lest
he should seem to give a scandal, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cedere potius
sua libertate voluit. Ideo non tantum
dicit: ne scandalizentur: sed ne scandalizemus

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect</span></span>. 3. Their answer is also false: 1.
There is no scandal taken but (if it be known
to be taken, and the thing at which it is
taken be not necessary) it is also given. The
scandal of the weak, in the apostles' times,
who were offended with the liberty of eating
all sorts of meats, was passive and taken,
as Zanchius observeth,<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a> yet was that scandal
given and peccant upon their part, who used
their liberty of eating all sorts of meats, and
so cared not for the offence of the weak.
Think they then that our taking of offence
can excuse their giving of offence? Nay,
since the things whereby they offend us are
no necessary things, they are greatly to be
blamed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the ceremonies are not necessary in
themselves our opposites acknowledge, and
that they are not necessary in respect of the
church's determination, I have proved in
the first part of my dispute. Wherefore,
having no necessity in them, they ought to
be abolished, when scandal is known to arise
out of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Giving and not granting that the scandal
of them who were first offended at the
ceremonies was only passive, yet the using of
them after scandal is known to rise out of
them, must be an active scandal, because
the keeping of a thing which is not necessary,
after scandal riseth out of it, is an active
scandal, though the scandal which at
first rose out of it had been only passive, as
I show in my seventh proposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The truth is, that both first and last
the scandal of the ceremonies is active and
given; for an active scandal is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dictum vel

is ever a sin in him who offendeth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quia vel

said, the ceremonies have a very great appearance
of evil, and so the scandal which
followeth them shall be proved to be active.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to discover the appearance of evil
which is in the ceremonies, let us consider
with Zanchius,<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> that the appearance of evil
from which the Apostle exhorteth to abstain
may be expounded two ways. First,
It may be referred to the preceding words,
and so meant of prophecy and trying the
doctrine of prophets or preachers, for we
should beware in this matter of all which
hath any appearance of evil, that is, from
all things, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quae ab haereticis in suam sententiam,
malamque consequentiam trahi
possunt</span></span>. For example, saith Zanchius,
Nestorius said, that we are saved by the
blood, not of the Son of God, but of the Son
of man. Now if any, suppressing that negative,
should say, we are saved by the blood
of the Son of man, though this might receive
a right explication, yet it hath an appearance
of evil, because from it Nestorius might
confirm his heresy. Appearance of evil thus
expounded will be found in the ceremonies
in question. If a phrase or form of speaking
from which heretics may draw bad consequences,
and confirm their errors, though
not truly, yet in show, be an appearance of
evil, then much more are visible ceremonies
and received customs, from which heretics
get occasion to confirm their heretical errors,
and damnable superstitions, very plain and
undeniable appearances of much evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now Papists confirm many of their superstitions
by the English ceremonies. Parker<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a>
giveth too many clear instances, namely,
that by the English cross Martial justifieth
the popish cross, and Saunders the popish
images. That the English service-book is
drawn by Parsons and Bristowe, to a countenancing
of their mass-book; that Rainold
draweth private baptism to a proof of the
necessity which they put in that sacrament;
that the Rhemists draw the absolution of
the sick, prescribed in the communion-book,
to an approbation of their absolution, auricular
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-095">[pg 1-095]</span><a name="Pg1-095" id="Pg1-095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
confession, and sacrament of penance.
To these instances I add, that the
Rhemists<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a>
confirm the least of their assumption of Mary
for the other feasts which the church of England
observeth. And so doth J. Hart.<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. It will be said, that Papists have
no ground nor reason to confirm any of their
superstitions by the English ceremonies. But
I answer: 1. If it were so, yet forasmuch
as Papists draw them to a confirmation of
their superstitions, we should abstain from
them as appearances of evil. Eating (at a
private banquet) of that which was sacrificed
to idols, did confirm an idolator and infidel
in his religion, as Pareus<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> noteth; yet from
this the idolator had no reason to confirm
himself in his idolatry; but because the idolator,
seeing it, might draw it to a confirmation,
the Apostle will have it for that respect
forborne. When the Arians abused
trin-immersion in baptism, to signify three
natures of the three persons, Pope
Gregory,<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a>
and the fourth council of Toledo ordained,<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a>
that in Spain, thrice washing should no
longer be used in baptism, but once only.
The Arians had no just reason to draw such
a signification from the ceremony of trin-immersion,
yet was it abolished when those
heretics did so abuse it. If any say, that
we are saved by the blood of the Son of man,
the phrase is orthodox, because of the communication,
or rather communion of properties,
and the Nestorians cannot with
good reason by it confirm their heresy, yet
are we to abstain from this form of speech,
in Zanchius's judgment, when it is drawn to
the confirmation of that error.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I conclude with that which Parker<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a> allegeth
out of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harmony of Confessions:
Cum adiaphora rapiuntur ad confessionem,
libera esse desinunt</span></span>. Mark <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rapiuntur</span></span>.
2. The ceremonies do indeed greatly
countenance those superstitions of Papists,
because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">communio rituum est quasi symbolum
communionis in religione</span></span>;<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> so that
Papists get occasion from the ceremonies, of
confirming, not only those popish rites which
we have not yet received, but also the whole
popish religion, especially since they see Conformists
so siding with them against Non-Conformists,
and making both their opinions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-096">[pg 1-096]</span><a name="Pg1-096" id="Pg1-096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and practices to be better than we reckon
them to be.

Saravia,<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> perceiving how much the popish
sacrament of confirmation is countenanced
and confirmed by our bishoping, thinks it
best to put the fairest face he can upon the
Papists' judgment of that bastard sacrament.
He would have us believe, that the Papists
do not extol the dignity of the sacrament of
confirmation above baptism. But he should
have considered that which Cartwright<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a>
marketh out of the first tome of the councils,
that in the epistle which is ascribed to
Eusebius and Melciades, bishops of Rome,
it is plainly affirmed, that the sacrament of
confirmation <span class="tei tei-q">“is more to be reverenced
than the sacrament of baptism.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. Zanchius hath another exposition
of the appearance of evil, which doth also
agree to the ceremonies. The appearance
of evil which maketh scandal, and from which
the Apostle would have us to abstain, may
be taken generally of all sorts of sin, and all
evil things whatsoever; for so we should abstain
from all that which hath any appearance
of evil; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nullam proebentes occasionem
proximo nostro aliquid mali de nobis suspicandi</span></span>.
He instanceth for example, the eating
of idolothites in Paul's time, 1 Cor. x.
Now if the eating of idolothite meats was an
appearance of evil, and so scandalous, because
it gave the weak occasion to suspect some
evil of such as did eat them, much more idolothite
rites which have not only been dedicated
and consecrated to the honour of idols,
but also publicly and commonly used and
employed in idolatrous worship; surely whosoever
useth such idolothites, gives great occasion
to his brother to suspect some evil of
him, because of such evil-favoured appearances.
And thus we see how great appearance
of evil is more than manifest in the
ceremonies, which maketh the scandal active,
if there were no more; but afterwards
we shall see the ceremonies to be evil and
unlawful in themselves, and so to be in the
worst kind of active scandal.

our adversaries, to make it appear that the
scandal of conformity is not active nor faulty
upon their part. 1. They say they are
blameless, because they render a reason of
that which they do, so that we may know
the lawfulness of it. To this sufficient answer
hath been made already by one whose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-097">[pg 1-097]</span><a name="Pg1-097" id="Pg1-097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
answers I may well produce to provoke Conformists
therewith, because no reply hath

if it be true, then see we an end of all the

What needed Paul to write so much against
the scandal of meats, and against the scandal
of idolothious meats? This one precept
might have sufficed, let the strong give
a reason for his eating, &amp;c. Though he hath
given many reasons to them of Corinth for
the lawfulness of taking wages; though he
hath given divers reasons for the lawfulness
of all sorts of meats to them of Rome, yet
neither will take wages himself, nor suffer
others to eat all sorts of meats, when others
are offended. And what is that which he
writeth Rom. x.? Take and receive the
weak for their supportance, and not for
controversy and disputation,”</span> &amp;c.

against our argument of scandal. And I

sorry they should be grieved; but it is their
own fault, for if the things be in themselves
lawful, what is it that should offend them?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. He does not well express scandal
(whereof he is there speaking) by grief;
for I may be grieved, yet not scandalised,
and scandalised, yet not grieved, according
to my first proposition touching scandal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. To what purpose tells he it is their own
fault? Thinks he that there are any offended
without their own fault? To be offended
is ever a fault,<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> as I show in my third

be not removed where it is men's own
fault that they are offended, then no scandal
shall ever be removed, because all who
are scandalised commit a fault in being scandalised.

occasion of ruin.

3. Why thinks he that if the things be in
themselves lawful, they are purged of scandal?
What if they edify not? 1 Cor. xx. 23.
What if they be not expedient? Are they
not therefore scandalous, because in themselves
lawful? This shift is destroyed by my
ninth proposition. And, I pray, were not
all meats lawful for the Gentiles in the apostles'
times? Yet this could not excuse
their eating all sorts of meats, when the
Jews were thereby offended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Whereas he demandeth, if the things
be in themselves lawful, what is it that should
offend them? I demand again, though adultery,
murder, &amp;c., be in themselves unlawful,
what is it that should offend us? Should
we offend or be scandalised for anything?
Nay, then, we should sin; for to be offended
is a sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. He had said to better purpose, What is
it that may offend them, or doth offend
them, that it may be voided? Whereunto
I answer, that there is a twofold scandal
which may be and hath been given by things
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-100">[pg 1-100]</span><a name="Pg1-100" id="Pg1-100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lawful in themselves (as I touched in my
fifth proposition), viz, the giving of occasion
to the weak to condemn our lawful deeds,
and the animating of them to follow our example
against their own consciences—both
ways we may make them to sin. The Apostle,
1 Cor. x. 29, where he is speaking of a
certain kind of idolothites which are in
themselves lawful, and only evil in the case
of scandal, showeth, that if the weak, in a
private banquet, see the strong eating such
meats as have been offered to idols, notwithstanding
of warning given, then is the weak
one scandalised, because, would the Apostle
say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vel ipse etiam edet tuo exemplo, vacillante

even out of things which are in themselves
lawful, which also ariseth out of the ceremonies
(let them be as lawful as can be). 1.
We art provoked to disallow of lawful things,
and to condemn the doers as superstitious
and popishly affected. 2. We are animated
by the example of Formalists to practise
conformity, which in our consciences we condemn,
and by consequence do sin, because he
that doubteth is damned, and whatsoever is
not of faith is sin.

of Edinburgh can help the cause. He will
have us not to respect scandal, because it is
removed by the law. <span class="tei tei-q">“For (saith he<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>) by
obedience to a lawful ordinance, no man
gives scandal, and if any take offence, both
the cause and occasion thereof is the perverseness
only of the person offended.”</span> Tertullian
saith well, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Res bona neminem offendit
nisi malam mentem</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. I show in my ninth proposition,
that the ordinance of superiors cannot make
that to be no scandal which otherwise should
be scandal. If this be not taken well from
us, let one of our opposites speak for us,
who acknowledgeth that human power cannot
make us do that which we cannot do
without giving of scandal, and that, in this
case, the pretext of obedience to superiors
shall not excuse us at the hands of the Supreme
Judge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. I would learn of him what makes a
lawful ordinance about matters of fact or
things to be done? Not the will of superiors,
else there shall be no unlawful ordinances
(for every ordinance hath the will of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-101">[pg 1-101]</span><a name="Pg1-101" id="Pg1-101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the ordainer), not the lawfulness of the
thing in itself which is ordained neither,
for then every ordinance which prescribeth
a thing lawful in itself, were it never so inexpedient
in respect of supervenient circumstances,
should be lawful. To a lawful ordinance
then is required, not only that the
thing ordained be lawful in itself, but also
that it be not inexpedient, so that a thing
may be lawful in itself, yet not lawfully ordained,
because the ordinance commandeth
the doing of it, whereas there are many
things lawful which ought not to be done,
because they are not expedient, 1 Cor. vi. 12.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Since it cannot be a lawful ordinance
which ordaineth a thing inexpedient, it cannot
be a lawful obedience which is yielded to
such an ordinance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. If by a lawful ordinance he mean (as it
seems he doth) an ordinance prescribing that
which is lawful in itself, then his answer is
false. What if an ordinance of superiors
had ordained the Corinthians to eat freely of
all meats which were in themselves clean?
Durst the Bishop say that this ordinance of
superiors had been of greater weight and
superior reason than the law of charity,
which is God's law? Had no man given
scandal by obedience to this ordinance?
And would not the Apostle for all that have
forbidden, as he did, the using of this liberty
with the offence of others?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. When any man is offended at a thing
lawful, prescribed by an ordinance, the cause
thereof is indeed in himself (yet it is not always
his perverseness, but oftimes weakness),
but the occasion of it is the thing at
which he offendeth, which occasion should
ever be removed when it is not a thing necessary,
as I showed already.

first, he will not hear us touching scandal,
except we first acknowledge the ceremonies
not to be evil in themselves otherwise he
thinks we debate in vain about scandal, since
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-102">[pg 1-102]</span><a name="Pg1-102" id="Pg1-102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we have a more convenient way to exterminate
the ceremonies, by proving them to be
evil in themselves, and also because, when
we are pressed with the weight of arguments,
we will still run back to this point,
that nothing which in itself is unlawful can
be done without scandal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. The argument of scandal is not
vainly or idly debated, for though we prove
the ceremonies to be evil in themselves, yet
fitly we argument also from the scandal of
them, because this maketh yet more. 1.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad rem</span></span>, for the scandal of a thing is more
than the unlawfulness of it; every unlawful
thing is not scandalous, but that only which
is done to the knowledge of another. 2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad
hominem</span></span>, for that we may either content
or convince our opposites, we argument <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex

since they yield the ceremonies to be in
themselves indifferent, therefore they must
acknowledge that they are to be forborne,
because scandal followeth upon them, and
they should abstain from things indifferent,
in the case of scandal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Whereas he thinks we will still turn
back to the unlawfulness of the ceremonies
in themselves, albeit we may justly make use
of this answer, when they go about to purge
the ceremonies from scandal by the lawfulness
of them in themselves, (because the
argument of scandal doth not presuppose our
concession of the lawfulness of the ceremonies,
but theirs,) yet he deceives himself in
thinking that we cannot handle this argument
without it, for were they never so
lawful in themselves, we evince the scandal
of them from the appearance of evil which is
in them,<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> so that, without respecting the
unlawfulness of the ceremonies in themselves,
we can and do make good our argument
of scandal, so far as concerneth the
ceremonies considered by themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when our opposites object, that many
are scandalised by us who refuse the ceremonies,
we here compare the scandal of non-conformity,
if there be any such (for though
some be displeased at it, I see not how they
are scandalised by it), with the scandal of conformity,
and show them that the scandal of
non-conformity is not to be cared for, because
it is necessary, and that by reason of the unlawfulness
of the ceremonies. I will make
all this plain by a simile.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A pastor dealing with a fornicator, layeth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-103">[pg 1-103]</span><a name="Pg1-103" id="Pg1-103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before him both his sin and the scandal of it
too. Now, as touching the scandal, the fornicator
careth not for it, because he is in
the opinion that fornication is indifferent.
Whereupon the pastor thus proceedeth, If
it were indifferent, as you say, yet because
scandal riseth out of it, you should abstain.
And so, amongst many arguments against
fornication, the pastor useth this argument
taken from the scandal of it, both for aggravating
the sin in itself, and for convincing
the sinner, and this argument of scandal the
pastor can make good against the fornicator
out of his own ultroneous and unrequired
concession of the indifferency of fornication
(because things indifferent, and in the case
of scandal, and when they are done with the
appearance of evil, should be forborne), without
ever mentioning the unlawfulness of it.
But if in a froward tergiversation, the fornicator
begin to reply, that he also is scandalised
and provoked to go on in his fornication
obstinately, by the pastor rebuking him
for so light a matter, and that the pastor's
reproof to him hath appearance of evil, as
much as his fornication hath to the pastor,
albeit here it may be answered, that the
pastor's reproof is not done inordinate, neither
hath any appearance of evil, except in
the fornicator's perverse interpretation, yet
for stopping the fornicator's mouth, as well
more forceably as more quickly, the pastor rejoineth,
that if any scandal follow upon his
reproof, it is not to be regarded, because the
thing is necessary, and that because fornication
being a great sin, he may not but reprove
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So, albeit our argument of scandal holdeth
out against the ceremonies considered by
themselves, without making mention of the
unlawfulness of them in themselves albeit
also when the scandal of non-conformity (if
there be any such) is compared with the
scandal of conformity, we say truly that this
hath appearance of evil in its own condition,
and that hath none, except in the false interpretation
of those who glory in gainsaying.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet for further convincing of our opposites,
and darting through their most subtile
subterfuges with a mortal stroke, we send
them away with this final answer,—You
should abstain from the ceremonies when
scandal riseth out of them, because you confess
them to be in themselves indifferent.
But we do avouch and prove them to be unlawful,
wherefore it is necessary for us to

back the argument of scandal upon our own
heads, and to charge us with scandalising both
the church and commonwealth by our refusing
the ceremonies. But what? should a doctor
be a dictator? or a proctor a prater? Why,
then, doth he ventilate words for reason?
That some are displeased at our non-conformity,
we understand to our great grief; but
that thereby any are scandalised, we understand
not; and if we did, yet that which is
necessary, such as non-conformity is, can be
taken away by no scandal.

that there is in the ceremonies so much as
any appearance of evil, to make them scandalous.
Where I observe, that he dare not
adventure to describe how a thing is said to
have appearance of evil, and consequently a
scandalous condition. The man is cautelous,
and perceiveth, peradventure, that the appearance
of evil can be made to appear no

nor discern how to make Christ the passive
object of that worship and the bread the
active, and how to worship Christ in the
bread, and make the worship relative from
the bread to Christ, are, by his example, induced
to bread-worship, when they perceive
bowing down before the consecrated bread
in the very same form and fashion wherein
Papists are seen to worship it, but cannot
conceive the nice distinctions which he and

There occurreth next an objection, taken
from Paul's not taking wages at Corinth

some words. The substance of his answer
is this, that Paul taught it was lawful
to take wages, and that they should not be
offended at it; and if we do as he did, we
must teach that the ceremonies are lawful in
themselves, yet not using our power for the
time, lest the weak be offended, or lest the
malicious glory: but for all that, not denying
our right and liberty, nor suffering a yoke of
bondage to be imposed upon us by contumacious
men. And, besides, that the Apostle
was commanded by no ecclesiastical decree
to take wages from the Corinthians, as we
are commanded by the decree of Perth to
receive the five Articles; so that Paul
might, without contempt of ecclesiastical
authority, abstain from taking of wages, but
we cannot, without contempt of the church,
reject the Articles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. This importeth, that if the question
were not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de jure</span></span>, and if we disliked the
ceremonies, and were offended at them, for
some other reason than their unlawfulness,
for this offence they would abstain. It may
be his reverend fathers return him small
thanks for this device. For let some men
be brought forth, acknowledging the ceremonies
to be in themselves indifferent, yet
offended at them for their inexpediency, whether
they be weak or malicious, the Doctor
thinks he should abstain for their cause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. How knows he that they who were
offended at Paul's taking of wages at Corinth,
thought not his taking of wages there
unlawful, even as we think the ceremonies
unlawful?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Why judgeth he that we are not scandalised
through weakness, but through malice
and contumacy? So he giveth it forth
both in this place and elsewhere.<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a> Who
art thou that judgest another man's servant?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, 4. If we were malicious in offending
at the ceremonies as things unlawful, and in
urging of non-conformity as necessary, should
they therefore contemn our being scandalised?
Those that would have Titus circumcised,
were they not malicious? Did they
not urge circumcision as necessary? Held
they it not unlawful not to circumcise Titus?
Yet did the Apostle abstain because they
were to be scandalised, that is, made worse
and more wicked calumniators by the circumcising
of Titus, as I have showed;<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-106">[pg 1-106]</span><a name="Pg1-106" id="Pg1-106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that albeit we know not to take care for the
displeasing of men that maliciously
(as necessary) abstaining
from that which is lawful to be done, yet
must we take care for scandalising them and
making them worse; rather, ere that be, we
ought to abstain from the use of our liberty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. If an ecclesiastical decree had commanded
Paul at that time to take wages at Corinth,
the Doctor thinks he had contemned ecclesiastical
authority in not taking wages,
though some should be offended at his taking
wages. What! could an ecclesiastical
decree command Paul to take wages in the
case of scandal? or could he have obeyed
such a decree in the case of scandal? We
have seen before that no human authority
can make that no scandal which otherwise
were scandal, so that Paul had not contemned
ecclesiastical authority by not obeying
their command in this case of scandal
which had followed by his obeying, for he
had not been bound to obey, nay, he had
been bound not to obey in such a case, yea,
further, albeit scandal had not been to follow
by his taking wages, yet he had no more
contemned the church by not obeying a
command to take wages than he had done
by living unmarried, if the church had commanded
him to marry. The bare authority
of the church could neither restrain his
liberty nor ours in things indifferent, when
there is no more to bind but the authority of
an ordinance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Why holds he us contemners of the
church for not receiving the five Articles of Perth?
We cannot be called contemners for
not obeying, but for not subjecting ourselves,
wherewith we cannot be charged. Could he
not distinguish betwixt subjection and obedience?
Art thou a Doctor in Israel, and
knowest not these things? Nil, art thou a
Conformist, and knowest not what thy fellow
Conformists do hold?

which the Doctor<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href="#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> holdeth him in this argument,
namely, that for the offence of the
weak necessary things are not to be omitted,
such as is obedience to superiors, but their
minds are to be better informed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Obedience to superiors cannot
purge that from scandal which otherwise
were scandal, as we have seen before.<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>

2. That information and giving of a reason
cannot excuse the doing of that out of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. That the ordinance of superiors cannot
make the ceremonies necessary, I have
proved in the first part of this dispute.
This is given for one of the chief marks of
the man of sin,<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“That which is indifferent,
he by his laws and prohibitions maketh to be
sin;”</span> and shall they who profess to take part
with Christ against antichrist, do no less
than this? It will be replied, that the ceremonies
are not thought necessary in themselves,
nor non-conformity unlawful in itself,
but only in respect of the church's ordinance.
Just so the Papists profess,<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> that
the omission of their rites and observances is
not a sin in itself, but only in respect of
contemning the church's customs and commandments.
How comes it, then, that they
are not ashamed to pretend such a necessity
for the stumbling-blocks of those offending
ceremonies among us, as Papists pretend for
the like among them?

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 14. But the English Formalists have
here somewhat to say, which we will hear.
Mr Hooker tells us,<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> that ceremonies are
scandalous, either in their very nature, or
else through the agreement of men to use
them unto evil; and that ceremonies of this
kind are either devised at first unto evil, or
else having had a profitable use, they are
afterwards interpreted and wrested to the
contrary. As for the English ceremonies,
he saith, that they are neither scandalous in
their own nature, nor because they were
devised unto evil, nor yet because they
of the church of England abuse them unto
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Though all this were true, yet
forasmuch as they have been abused by the
Papists unto idolatry and superstition, and
are monuments of Popery, the trophies of
Antichrist, and the relics of Rome's whorish
bravery,—they must be granted, at least for
this respect, to be more than manifest appearances
of evil, and so scandalous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But secondly, It is false which he saith;
for kneeling in receiving the communion is,
in its own nature, evil and idolatrous, because
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-108">[pg 1-108]</span><a name="Pg1-108" id="Pg1-108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
religious adoration before a mere creature,
which purposely we set before us in the
act of adoring, to have state in the worship,
especially if it be an actual image in that act
representing Christ to us (such as the bread
in the act of receiving) draweth us within
the compass of co-adoration or relative worship,
as shall be copiously proved afterwards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other of the ceremonies that are not evil
in their own nature, yet were devised to
evil; for example, the surplice. The replier<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a>
to Dr Mortoune's particular defence,
observeth, that this superstition about apparel
in divine worship, began first among
the French bishops, unto whom Cælestinus
writeth thus:—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Discernendi, &amp;c.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“We are
to be distinguished from the common people
and others by doctrine, not by garment,—by
conversation, not by habit,—by the purity of
mind, not by attire; for if we study to innovation,
we tread under foot the order which
hath been delivered unto us by our fathers,
to make place to idle superstitions; wherefore
we ought not to lead the minds of the
faithful into such things, for they are rather
to be instructed than played withal; neither
are we to blind and beguile their eyes, but
to infuse instructions into their minds.”</span> In
which words Cælestinus reprehends this apparel,
as a novelty which tended to superstition,
and made way to the mocking and deceiving
of the faithful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, Whereas he saith the ceremonies
are not abused by them in England, I instance
the contrary in holidays. Perkins
saith,<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a> that the feast of Christ's nativity, so
commonly called, is not spent in praising the
name of God, but in rifling, dicing, carding,
masking, mumming, and in all licentious
liberty, for the most part, as though it were
some heathen feast of Ceres or Bacchus.
And elsewhere<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a>
he complaineth of the great
abuses of holidays among them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 15. As touching the rule which is
alleged against the ceremonies out of Paul's
doctrine, namely, that in those things from
which we may lawfully abstain, we should
frame the usage of our liberty with regard
to the weakness of our brethren. Hooker
answereth to it, 1. That the weak brethren
among them were not as the Jews, who were
known to be generally weak, whereas, saith
he, the imbecility of ours is not common to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-109">[pg 1-109]</span><a name="Pg1-109" id="Pg1-109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so many, but only here and there some such
an one is found. 2. He tells us that these
scandalous meats, from which the Gentiles
were exhorted to abstain for fear of offending
the Jews, cannot represent the ceremonies,
for their using of meats was a matter
of private action in common life, where every
man was free to order that which himself
did, but the ceremonies are public constitutions
for ordering the church, and we are
not to look that the church is to change her
public laws and ordinances, made according
to that which is judged ordinarily and commonly
fittest for the whole, although it
chance that, for some particular men, the
same be found inconvenient, especially when
there may be other remedies also against
the sores of particular inconveniences. Let
them be better instructed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. This is bad divinity that would
make us not regard the scandalising of a
few particular men. Christ's woe striketh
not only upon them who offend many, but
even upon them who offend so much as one
of his little ones, Matt. xviii 6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That which he saith of the few in
England, and not many, who are scandalised
by the ceremonies, hath been answered by
a countryman of his own.<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> And as for us,
we find most certainly that not a few, but
many, even the greatest part of Scotland,
one way or other, are scandalised by the
ceremonies. Some are led by them to drink
in superstition, and to fall into sundry gross
abuses in religion, others are made to use
them doubtingly, and so damnably. And
how many who refuse them are animated to
use them against their consciences, and so
to be damned? Who is not made to stumble?
And what way do they not impede
the edificatlon of the church?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. What if there had been a public constitution,
commanding the Gentiles to eat
all meats freely, and that this hath been
judged ordinarily and commonly fittest for
the whole, even to signify the liberty of the
church of the New Testament? Should not
the Gentiles, notwithstanding of this constitution,
have abstained because of the scandal
of the Jews? How comes it then, that that
which the Apostle writeth against the scandal
of meats, and the reasons which he giveth,
are found to hold over good, whether
there be a constitution or not?

4. As for his remedy against the scandal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-110">[pg 1-110]</span><a name="Pg1-110" id="Pg1-110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of particular men, which is to instruct them

before.<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href="#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 16. Now, if I reckon Paybody to
be no body, perhaps some body will not take
it well. I will therefore examine how he
handleth this argument. Four things are
answered by him<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422" href="#note_422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a> to those places, Rom. xiv.
16; 1 Cor. viii. 10; Matt. xviii. 6, which
are alleged against the use of things indifferent,
when we cannot use them without
scandal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, he saith, that all those Scriptures
which are quoted as condemning the scandalising
of others in things indifferent,
speak only of scandalising them who are
weak.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Be it so, thought he, that they
are all malicious, and none weak, who are
offended by the ceremonies. He himself
describeth the weak whom we are forbidden
to scandalise, to be such as are weak in knowledge
and certainty of the truth. Now
there are many who are in this respect weak,
scandalised by the ceremonies. But I say,
moreover, that his description is imperfect;
for there are some who know the truth, and
that certainly, who are, notwithstanding, to
be accounted weak, in regard of the defect of
that prudence which should guide, and that
stability which should accompany all their
actions, in the particular usage of such things
as they know certainly, in their general
kind, to be agreeable to truth and righteousness.
Such Christians are impeded by
the ceremonies from going on in their Christian
course so fast as otherwise they would,
if not also made to waver or stumble. And
thus are they properly scandalised according
to my fifth proposition. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Si quis nostra
culpa vel impingit, vel abducitur a recto
cursu, vel tardatur, cum dicimur offendere</span></span>,
saith Calvin.<a id="noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Porro scandalum est
dictum vel factum quo impeditur evangelii

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. It is a fault to give offence even to the
strong, or else Peter was not to be blamed
for giving offence to Christ, Matt. xvi. 23.
Yea, it is a fault to offend the very malicious
by things that are not necessary, as I
have proved in my twelfth proposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 17. Secondly, saith he, all those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-111">[pg 1-111]</span><a name="Pg1-111" id="Pg1-111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Scriptures condemn only the scandal of the
weak which is made at that time when we
know they will be scandalised.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. If he speak of certain and infallible
knowledge, none but God knoweth
whether a man shall be scandalised or not,
by that which we are to do. He must
mean, therefore, of such knowledge as we
can have of the event of our actions, and so
his answer bringeth great damage to his own
cause. Formalists know that then weak
brethren have been of a long time scandalised
by the ceremonies, and they hear them
professing that they are yet scandalised, and
how then can they but know that scandal
will still follow upon that which they do?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Albeit they know not that their brethren
will be scandalised by the ceremonies,
yea, albeit then brethren should not be scandalised
thereby, yet because the ceremonies
are appearances of evil, inductive to
sin, and occasions of ruin, scandal is given
by them, whether it be taken by their brethren
or not, according to my fourth and fifth
propositions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 18. Thirdly, saith Paybody, all
those Scriptures condemn only that offence
of another in things indifferent, which is
made by him who is at liberty and not
bound, they speak not of using or refusing
those things, as men are tied by the commandment
of authority. Where he laboureth
to prove that obedience to the magistrate
in a thing indifferent is a better duty
than the pleasing of a private person in such
a thing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. I have proved heretofore, that
the commandment of authority cannot make
the use of a thing indifferent to be no scandal,
which otherwise were scandal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. I have also proved in the first part of
this dispute, that an ecclesiastical constitution
cannot bind us, nor take away our liberty
in the using or not using of a thing
indifferent in itself, except some other reason
be showed us than the bare authority of
the church. As touching the civil magistrate's
place and power to judge and determine
in things pertaining to the worship
of God, we shall see it afterwards, and so
shall we know how far his decisions and ordinances
in this kind of things have force to
bind us to obedience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. He should have proved that obedience
to the magistrate in a thing indifferent, is a
better duty than abstaining from that which
scandaliseth many Christians. He should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-112">[pg 1-112]</span><a name="Pg1-112" id="Pg1-112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not have opposed pleasing and scandalising
(for perhaps a man is most scandalised when
he is most pleased), but edifying and scandalising,
according to my first proposition.
Now, will anybody except Paybody say, that
obedience to the magistrate in a thing indifferent,
out of which scandal riseth, is a
better duty than forbearing for the edification
of many Christian souls, and for shunning
to scandalise them. This we must take
to be his meaning, or else he saith nothing
to the purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 19. His fourth answer is, that all
those scriptures condemning scandal, must
needs especially condemn that which is greatest.
Peter and his companions coming to
Antioch, were in danger of a double scandal;
either of the Jews by eating with the
Gentiles, which was the less, or of the Gentiles
in refusing their company, as if they
had not been brethren, which was far the
greater. Now Paul blamed Peter very
much, that for the avoiding the lesser scandal,
he and his companions fell into the
greater.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. He is greatly mistaken whilst he
thinks that a man can be so straitened betwixt
two scandals, that he cannot choose but
give the one of them. For, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nulla datur
talis perplexitas, ut necessarium sit pro
homini sive hoc sive illud faciat, scandalum
alicui dare</span></span>.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href="#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That sentence of choosing the least of
two evils, must be understood of evils of
punishment, not of evils of sin, as I showed
before,<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a>
so that he is in a foul error whilst
he would have us to choose the least of two
scandals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. As for the example which he allegeth,
he deceiveth himself to think that Peter had
given scandal to the Jews by his eating
with the Gentiles. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cum Gentibus cibum
capiens, recte utebatur libertate Christiana</span></span>,
say the Magdeburgians;<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a> but when certain
Jews came from James, he withdrew himself,
fearing the Jews, and so <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod ante de
libertate Christiana aedificarat, rursus
destruebat</span></span>, by eating, then, with the Gentiles,
he gave no scandal, but by the contrary
he did edify. And farther, I say,
that his eating with the Gentiles was a
thing necessary, and that for shunning of
two great scandals; the one of the Gentiles,
by compelling them to Judaise; the other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-113">[pg 1-113]</span><a name="Pg1-113" id="Pg1-113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Jews, by confirming them in Judaism,
both which followed upon his withdrawing
from the Gentiles; so that by his eating
with the Gentiles no scandal could be given,
and if any had been taken, it was not to be
cared for. Wherefore there was but one
scandal which Peter and his companions
were in danger of, which also they did give,
and for which Paul apprehended them,
namely, their withdrawing of themselves
from the Gentiles, and keeping company
only with the Jews, whereby both the Jews
and the Gentiles were scandalised, because
both were made to think (at least occasion
was given to both for thinking) the observation
of the ceremonial law necessary. That
which deceiveth Paybody, is the confounding
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scandalising</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">displeasing</span></em>. Peter,
by eating with the Gentiles, perhaps
had displeased the Jews, but he had thereby
edified them, though the scandal which
he gave them was by Judaising; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judaizabat
olim Petrus per dissimulationem</span></span>,
saith Gerson:<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> by this Judaising through
such dissimulation and double-dealing, as
was his eating with the Gentiles first, and
then withdrawing of himself, when certain
Jews came; for keeping company with them
only, he scandalised the Jews and confirmed
them in Judaism, as Pareus noteth.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> How
then can it be said, that he that scandalised
them by his eating with the Gentiles? For
hereupon it should follow that there was a
necessity of doing evil laid upon Peter, so
that he behoved to offend the Jews either
by his eating with the Gentiles, or by his
not eating with the Gentiles; for he could
not both eat with them and not eat with
them. This is therefore plain, that if he
scandalised the Jews by his not eating with
the Gentiles, as I have showed, then had he
not scandalised them, but edified them by
his eating with the Gentiles.

I perceive he would say, that the scandal
of non-conformity is a greater scandal than
the scandal of conformity; and so he would
make us gain little by our argument of scandal.
He is bold to object,<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Where one is

Yet, I reply, 1. Though sundry (yet not
ten thousand for one) are displeased by our
refusal, who can show us that any are thereby
scandalised; that is, made worse and induced
to ruin? This man is bold to say well to
it; but we have solidly proved that scandal
riseth out of kneeling and the rest of the
ceremonies: let it be measured to us with the
same measure wherewith we mete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Put the case, that ten thousand were
scandalised by our refusal, will it thereupon
follow that our refusal is a greater scandal
than their practising? Nay, then, let it be
said that the cross of Christ is a greater
scandal than a private man's fornication, because
both Jews and Greeks were offended
at that, 1 Cor. i. 23; whereas, perhaps, a
small congregation only is offended at this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Our refusal is necessary, because of the
unlawfulness of the ceremonies which we
refuse, so that we may not receive them, but
must refuse them, notwithstanding of any
scandal which can follow upon our refusal.
If he had aught to say against this answer,
why is he silent? He might have found it at
home. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our forbearance of conformity
(saith Parker<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a>) is a necessary duty, there is
therein no fault of any scandal in us.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Our opposites should do well to assail
our argument of scandal before they propound
any other argument against us; for so
long as they make it not evident that the
scandal of the ceremonies, which we object,
is an active or faulty scandal, so long they
cannot object the scandal of non-conformity
to us; because if the scandal (which is to be
avoided) be in their practising of the ceremonies,
it cannot be in our refusing of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. We know many are grieved and displeased
with our non-conformity, yet that
every one who is grieved is not by and by
scandalised, the Bishop of Winchester teacheth
as well as we. <span class="tei tei-q">“Many times (saith he<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a>)
men are grieved with that which is for their
good, and earnestly set on that which is not
expedient for them.”</span> But, in good earnest,
what do they mean who say they are scandalised,
or made worse by our non-conformity?
for neither do we make them condemn
our lawful deed as unlawful, nor yet
do we animate them by our example to do
that which, in their consciences, they judge
unlawful. They themselves acknowledge
that sitting is as lawful as kneeling; that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-115">[pg 1-115]</span><a name="Pg1-115" id="Pg1-115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not-observing of the five holidays is as lawful
as the observing of them; that the not-bishoping
of children is as lawful as the bishoping
of them. Do they not acknowledge
the indifferency of the things themselves?
Do they not permit many of their people
either to kneel or to sit at the communion?
Have not many of themselves taken the communion
sitting in some places? Have not
our Conformists in Scotland hitherto commonly
omitted bishoping of children, and
the ministration of the sacraments in private
places? As for ourselves we make our
meaning plain when we object the scandal
of conformity; for many ignorant and superstitious
persons are, by the ceremonies, confirmed
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">expertus loquor</span></span>) in their error and
superstition; so that now they even settle
themselves upon the old dregs of popish
superstition and formality, from which they
were not well purged. Others are made to
practise the ceremonies with a doubting and
disallowing conscience, and to say with Naaman,
<span class="tei tei-q">“In this the Lord be merciful unto
us if we err:”</span> with my own ears have I
heard some say so. And even those who
have not practised the ceremonies, for that
they cannot see the lawfulness of them, yet
are animated by the example of practising
Conformists to do these things which, in
their consciences, they condemn as unlawful
(which were to sin damnably), and if they do
them not, then is there no small doubting
and disquietness, trouble, and trepidation,
harboured in their consciences. And thus,
one way or other, some weakening or deterioration
cometh to us by the means of the
ceremonies; and if any of our opposites dare
think that none of us can be so weak as to
stumble or take any harm in this kind, because
of the ceremonies, we take God himself
to witness, who shall make manifest the
counsels of the heart, that we speak the truth,
and lie not.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My first argument against the lawfulness
of the ceremonies I draw from the superstition
of them. I cannot marvel enough how
Dr Mortoune and Dr Burges could think to
rub the superstition upon Non-conformists,
whom they set forth as fancying their abstinence
from the ceremonies to be a singular
piece of service done to God, placing religion
in the not using of them, and teaching men
to abstain from them for conscience' sake.
Dr Ames<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> hath given a sufficient answer,
namely, that abstaining from sin is one act
of common obedience, belonging as well to
things forbidden in the second table, as to
those forbidden in the first; and that we do
not abstain from those ceremonies but as
from other unlawful corruptions, even out of
the compass of worship. We abstain from
the ceremonies even as from lying, cursing,
stealing, &amp;c. Shall we be holden superstitious
for abstaining from things unlawful?
The superstition therefore is not on our side,
but on theirs:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. For, 1st, Superstition is the
opposite vice to religion, in the excess,
as our divines describe it; for it exhibits
more in the worship of God than he
requires in his worship. Porro saith,<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a>

to be in the addition of ceremonies
not instituted by Christ, as well
as in the addition of more substantial matters.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Superstitio</span></span> (as some derive the word)
is that which is done <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supra statutum</span></span>; and
thus are the controverted ceremonies superstitious,
as being used in God's worship upon
no other ground than the appointment of
men.

Now our ceremonies, though they
exhibit worship to God, yet this is done inordinately,
and they make the worship to
be otherwise performed than it should be;
for example, though God be worshipped by
the administration of the sacraments in private
places, yet not so as he should be worshipped.
The Professors of Leyden<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> condemn
private baptism as inordinate, because
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">baptismus publici ministerii, non privatæ
exhortationis est appendix</span></span>. It is marked
in the fourth century,<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> both out of councils
and fathers, that it was not then permitted
to communicate in private places; but this
custom was thought inordinate and unbeseeming.
If it be said, that the communion
was given to the sick privately in the ancient
church, I answer: Sometimes this was permitted,
but for such special reasons as do not
concern us; for, as we may see plainly by
the fourteenth canon of the first Council of
Nice (as those canons are collected by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-119">[pg 1-119]</span><a name="Pg1-119" id="Pg1-119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Ruffinus), the sixty-ninth canon of the
Council of Eleberis, and the sixth canon of
the Council of Ancyra, the communion was
only permitted to be given in private houses
to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">paenitentes</span></span>, who were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abstenti</span></span> and
debarred from the sacrament, some for three
years, some for five, some for seven, some for
ten, some for thirteen, some longer, and who
should happily be overtaken with some dangerous
and deadly sickness before the set
time of abstention was expired. As for the
judgment of our own divines, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Calviniani</span></span>, saith
Balduine,<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">morem illum quo eucharastia

a better ordinance than that of Perth, which

to be superstitious, by this reason, if there
were no more, they have no necessary nor
profitable use in the church (as hath been
proved), which kind of things cannot be used
without superstition. It was according to
this rule that the Waldenses<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> and Albigenses
taught that the exorcisms, breathings, crossings,
salt, spittle, unction, chrism, &amp;c. used
by the church of Rome in baptism, being
neither necessary nor requisite in the administration
of the same, did occasion error
and superstition, rather than edification to
salvation,

4th. They are yet more superstitious, for
that they are not only used in God's worship
unnecessary and unprofitably, but likewise
they hinder other necessary duties. They
who, though they serve the true God, <span class="tei tei-q">“yet

to him as from him. What offices more
unnecessary than those Roman rituals? yet
what more necessary duties than to worship
God in a spiritual and lively manner,—to
press the power of godliness upon the consciences
of professors,—to maintain and keep
faithful and well qualified ministers in the
church,—to bear the bowels of mercy and
meekness,—not to offend the weak, nor to
confirm Papists in Popery,—to have all

to the word, and not according to the will of
man,—not to exercise lordship over the consciences
of those whom Christ hath made
free,—to abolish the monuments of by-past
and badges of present idolatry; yet are those
and other necessary duties shut quite out of
doors by our needless ceremonial service.

way as much holiness and worship in them

that after a sort the ceremonies
are worship in themselves, even such a worship
as was that of the free-will offerings
under the law, and such a worship as was
the building and use of altars here and
there<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a>
(before God had chosen out the
standing place for his altar), though to the
same end for which the Lord's instituted
altar served. Thus we see that they offer
the ceremonies as worship to God: yet put
the case they did not, the school saith,<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a> that
a thing belongeth to the worship of God, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vel

Whereupon it followeth, that superstition
is not only to be laid to their
charge who offer to God for worship that
which he hath not commanded, but theirs
also who assume in God's worship the help
of anything as sacred or holy which himself
hath not ordained. 2. They place as great
a necessity in the ceremonies as Papists

now superstitiously they place worship in
them; for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quaecunque observatio quasi

The Rhemists think,<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> that meats of themselves,
or of their own nature, do not defile,
<span class="tei tei-q">“but so far as by accident they make a man
to sin; as the disobedience of God's commandment,
or of our superiors, who forbid
some meats for certain times and causes, is a
sin.”</span> And they add, <span class="tei tei-q">“that neither flesh
nor fish of itself doth defile, but the breach of
the church's precept defileth.”</span> Aquinas<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a>
defendeth that trin-immersion is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de necessitate

baptise otherwise, because this rite is instituted
and used by the church. Do not
Formalists place the same necessity in the
ceremonies, while, as they say, they urge
them not as necessary in themselves, but
only as necessary in respect of the determination
of the church, and the ordinance of
those who are set over us? Nay, Papists
place not so great necessity in many ordinances
of their church as Formalists place in
the ceremonies. If the cause be doubtful,
Aquinas<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a>
sends a man to seek a dispensation
from the superior. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">si causa sit evidens,
per seipsum licite potest homo statuti observantiam
praeterire</span></span>. What Formalist dare
yield us such liberty, as by ourselves, and
without seeking a dispensation from superiors,
to neglect the observation of their statutes,
when we see evident cause for so
doing? They think that we have no power
at our own hand to judge that we have an
evident cause of not obeying those who are
set over us; yet this much is allowed by this
Papist, who also elsewhere acknowledged<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>
that there is nothing necessary in baptism
but the form, the minister, and the washing
of water, and that all the other ceremonies
which the church of Rome useth in baptism
are only for solemnity. Bellarmine saith,<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a>
that the neglecting and not observing the
ceremonies of the church, with them is not
a mortal sin, except it proceed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex contemptu</span></span>.
And that he who, entering into a church,
doth not asperge himself with holy water,
sinneth not,<a id="noteref_461" name="noteref_461" href="#note_461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a> if so be he do it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">circa contemptum</span></span>.
Now, to be free of contempt
will not satisfy our Formalists, except we
obey and do that very same thing which we
are commanded to do. Cornelius Jansenius,<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a>
commenting upon these words, <span class="tei tei-q">“In vain do
they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men,”</span> saith, that the
commandments of men there forbidden and
condemned, are those which command nothing
divine, but things merely human;
and therefore he pleadeth for the constitutions
of the church about feasts, choice of
meats, festivities, &amp;c., and for obedience to
the same upon no other ground than this,
because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pius quisque facile videt quam

aut ad fidelium unionem et edificationem</span></span>.
I know it to be false which this Papist
affirmeth; yet in that he thus pleadeth for
those constitutions of the church from Scripture
and reason, forsaking the ground of
human authority, he is a great deal more
modest and less superstitious than those our
opposites, who avouch the ceremonies as
necessary, and will have us bound to the
practice of them upon no other ground than
the bare will and authority of superiors, who
have enjoined them, as hath been shown in
the first part of this dispute. Yea, some of
them place a certain and constant necessity
in the ceremonies themselves, even beside
and without the church's constitution (which
is more than Papists have said of their ceremonies).
Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href="#note_463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a> calleth the Articles of
Perth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pauca necessaria</span></span>, &amp;c., a few things
necessary for God's glory, and the promoting
of piety in our church, for order, peace, unity,
and charity; and particularly he teacheth,
that a minister may not lawfully omit to
administer the sacraments in private places,
and without the presence of the congregation,
to such as through sickness cannot
come to the public assemblies; which he
calleth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eis necessaria ministrare</span></span>. To say
the truth, the ministration of the sacraments
in private places importeth a necessity in the
matter itself, for which cause the divines of
Geneva resolved<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464" href="#note_464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a> that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiis publice
institutis</span></span>, baptism might not be administered
in private places, but only publicly in
the congregation of the faithful, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">partim ne
sacramenta, &amp;c.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“partly (say they) lest
the sacraments, being separate from the
preaching of the word, should be again transformed
in certain magical ceremonies, as in
Popery it was; partly that the gross superstition
of the absolute necessity of external
baptism may be rooted out of the minds of
men.”</span> Sure, the defenders of private baptism
place too great necessity in that sacrament.
Hooker plainly insinuates<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a> the absolute
necessity of outward baptism, at least
in wish or desire, which is the distinction of
the schoolmen, and followed by the modern
Papists to cloak their superstition. But
whatsoever show it hath, it was rightly impugned
in the Council of Trent<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a> by Marianarus,

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-124">[pg 1-124]</span><a name="Pg1-124" id="Pg1-124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
said to Cornelius his prayers were acceptable
to God, before ever he knew of the sacrament
of baptism; so that, having no knowledge
of it, he could not be said to have received
it, no not in vow or wish; and that
many holy martyrs were converted in the
heat of persecution, by seeing the constancy
of others, and presently taken and put to
death, of whom one cannot say, but by divination,
that they knew the sacraments, and
made a vow.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Times (saith he) are appointed by our
church for morning and evening prayers in
great towns; hours for preaching on Tuesday,
Thursday, &amp;c.; hours for weekly exercises
of prophecying, which are holy in respect
of the use whereunto they are appointed;
and such are the five days which we esteem
not to be holy, for any mystic signification
which they have, either by divine or ecclesiastical
institution, or for any worship which
is appropriated unto them, that may not be
performed at another time, but for the sacred
use whereunto they are appointed to be
employed as circumstances only, and not as
mysteries.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> This is but falsely pretended,
for as Didoclavius observeth,<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aliud
est deputare, aliud dedicare, aliud sanctificare</span></span>.
Designation or deputation is when
a man appoints a thing for such an use, still
reserving power and right to put it to another
use if he please; so the church appointeth
times and hours for preaching upon the
week-days, yet reserving power to employ
those times otherwise, when she shall think
fit. Dedication is when a man so devotes a
thing to some pious or civil use, that he denudes
himself to all right and title which
thereafter he might claim unto it, as when a
man dedicates a sum of money for the building
of an exchange, a judgment-hall, &amp;c., or
a parcel of ground for a church, a churchyard,
a glebe, a school, an hospital, he can
claim no longer right to the dedicated
thing. Sanctification is the setting apart of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-125">[pg 1-125]</span><a name="Pg1-125" id="Pg1-125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a thing for a holy and religious use, in such
sort that hereafter it may be put to no other
use, Prov. xx. 25. Now whereas times set
apart for ordinary and weekly preaching, are
only designed by the church for this end
and purpose, so that they are not holy, but
only for the present they are applied to an
holy use; neither is the worship appointed
as convenient or beseeming for those times,
but the times are appointed as convenient
for the worship. Festival days are holy both
by dedication and consecration of them; and
thus much the Bishop himself forbeareth not
to say,<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a>
only he laboureth to plaster over
his superstition with the untempered mortar
of this quidditative distinction, that some
things are holy by consecration of them to
holy and mystical uses,<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href="#note_471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a> as water in baptism,
&amp;c., but other things are made holy by
consecration of them to holy political uses.
This way, saith he, the church hath power
to make a thing holy, as to build and consecrate
places to be temples, houses to be hospitals;
to give rent, lands, money and goods,
to the ministry and to the poor; to appoint
vessels, and vestures, and instruments for
the public worship, as table, table-cloths,
&amp;c. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. The Bishop, I see, taketh
upon him to coin new distinctions at his own
pleasure; yet they will not, I trust, pass
current among the judicious. To make things
holy by consecration of them to holy uses for
policy, is an uncouth speculation, and, I dare
say, the Bishop himself comprehendeth it
not. God's designation of a thing to any
use, which serves for his own glory, is called
the sanctification of that thing, or the making
of it holy, and so the word is taken,
Isa. xiii. 3; Jer. i. 5, as G. Sanctius noteth
in his commentaries upon these places;
and Calvin, commenting upon the same
places, expoundeth them so likewise; but
the church's appointing or designing of a
thing to an holy use, cannot be called the
making of it holy. It must be consecrated
at the command of God, and by virtue of
the word and prayer: thus are bread and
wine consecrated in the holy supper, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Res
sacrae</span></span>, saith Fennerus,<a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href="#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sunt quae Dei verbo

call only such things, persons, times and

to God and his worship, and that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">divina

drink cannot be sanctified to us, so that we
may lawfully, and with a good conscience,
use those common things, but by the word of
God and prayer, how then shall anything be
made holy for God's worship but by the same
means? 1 Tim. iv. 5. And, I pray, which
is the word, and which be the prayers, that
make holy those things which the Bishop
avoucheth for things consecrated and made
holy by the church, namely, the ground
whereupon the church is built, the stones
and timber of an hospital; the rents, lands,
money, or goods given to the ministry and
the poor; the vessels, vestures, tables, napkins,
basons, &amp;c., appointed for the public
worship.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 8. 2d. Times, places and things, which
the church designeth for the worship of God,
if they be made holy by consecration of
them to holy political uses, then either they
may be made holy by the holy uses to which
they are to be applied, or else by the church's
dedicating of them to those uses. They cannot
be called holy by virtue of their application to holy
uses; for then (as Ames argueth<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a>)
the air is sacred, because it is applied
to the minister's speech whilst he is preaching,
then is the light sacred which is applied
to his eye in reading, then are his spectacles
sacred which are used by him reading his
text, &amp;c. But neither yet are they holy,
by virtue of the church's dedicating of them
to those uses for which she appointed them;
for the church hath no such power as by her
dedication to make them holy. P. Martyr<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a>

whereby the Papists hallow churches, and he
declareth against it the judgment of our

requiri, ut in prima cujusque rei usurpatione
gratias Deo agamus, ejusque bonitatem

opposeth to the popish dedication of temples
and bells, as appeareth by these words:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quanto sanius rectusque decernimus.</span></span> He
implieth, therefore, that these things are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-127">[pg 1-127]</span><a name="Pg1-127" id="Pg1-127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only consecrated as every other thing is

he hath given examples. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In libro

walls of Jerusalem then, and as our ordinary
meat are consecrated, so are churches
consecrated, and no otherwise can they
be said to be dedicated, except one would
use the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dedication</span></span>, in that sense
wherein it is taken, Deut. xx. 5; where
Calvin turns the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dedicavit</span></span>; Arias
Montanus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">initiavit</span></span>; Tremelius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">caepit uti</span></span>.
Of this sort of dedication, Gaspar Sanctius
writeth thus: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alia dedicatio est, non solum
inter prophanos, sed etiam inter Haebreos
usitata, quae nihil habet sacrum sed tantum
est auspicatio aut initium operis, ad

dedicasse dicitur domum suam cum primum
illam habitare caepit. Ita Suetonius
in Nerone. Sic Pompeius dedicavit theatrum
suum, cum primum illud publicis
ludis et communibus usibus aperuit; de
quo Cicero,</span></span> lib. 2, epist. 1. Any other sort
of dedicating churches we hold to be superstitious.
Peter Waldus, of whom the Waldenses
were named, is reported to have
taught that the dedication of temples was
but an invention of the devil.<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> And though
churches be dedicated by preaching and
praying, and by no superstition of sprinkling
them with holy water, or using such
magical rites, yet even these dedications,
saith the Magdeburgians,<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex Judaismo

There is, indeed, no warrant for such dedication
of churches as is thought to make
them holy. Bellarmine would warrant it
by Moses' consecrating of the tabernacle, the
altar, and the vessels of the same; but Hospinian
answereth him:<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href="#note_479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">479</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mosis factum expressum

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-128">[pg 1-128]</span><a name="Pg1-128" id="Pg1-128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he concludeth that this ceremony of
consecrating or dedicating the churches of
Christians, is not to be used after the example
of Moses, who, in building and dedicating
of the tabernacle, did follow nothing
without God's express commandment. What
I have said against the dedication of churches,
holds good also against the dedication of altars;
the table whereupon the elements of
the body and blood of Christ are set, is not
to be called holy; neither can they be commended
who devised altars in the church, to
be the seat of the Lord's body and blood, as
if any table, though not so consecrated, could
not as well serve the turn. And what though
altars were used in the ancient church? Yet
this custom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à Judaica, in ecclesiam Christi

Altars savour of nothing but Judaism, and
the borrowing of altars from the Jews, hath
made Christians both to follow their priesthood
and their sacrifices. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hæc enim trio,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 9. 3d. If some times, places and
things, be made holy by the church's dedication
or consecration of them to holy uses,
then it followeth that other times, places and
things, which are not so dedicated and consecrated
by the church, howbeit they be applied
to the same holy uses, yet are more profane,
and less apt to divine worship, than those
which are dedicated by the church. I need
not insist to strengthen the inference of this
conclusion from the principles of our opposites;
for the most learned among them will
not refuse to subscribe to it. Hooker teacheth
us,<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a> that the service of God, in places
not sanctified as churches are, hath not in
itself (mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in itself</span></em>) such perfection of grace
and comeliness, as when the dignity of the
place which it wisheth for, doth concur; and
that the very majesty and holiness of the place
where God is worshipped, bettereth even our
holiest and best actions. How much more
soundly do we hold with J. Rainolds,<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> that
unto us Christians, <span class="tei tei-q">“no land is strange, no
ground unholy,—every coast is Jewry, every
town Jerusalem, and every house Sion,—and
every faithful company, yea, every faithful
body, a temple to serve God in.”</span> The contrary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-129">[pg 1-129]</span><a name="Pg1-129" id="Pg1-129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alligat enim religionem ad

among two or three gathered together in his
name, maketh any place a church, even as
the presence of a king with his attendants
maketh any place a court. As of places, so
of times, our opposites think most superstitiously.
For of holidays Hooker saith thus,<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“No doubt as God's extraordinary presence
hath hallowed and sanctified certain places,
so they are his extraordinary works that
have truly and worthily advanced certain

all men that honour God more holy than

For just so the Rhemists think that the
times and places of Christ's nativity,<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a>
passion, burial, resurrection, and ascension,
were made holy; and just so Bellarmine
holdeth,<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> that Christ did consecrate
the days of his nativity, passion, and resurrection,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eo quod nascens consecrarit præsepe,
moriens crucem, resurgens sepulchrum</span></span>.
Hooker hath been of opinion, that
the holidays were so advanced above other
days, by God's great and extraordinary works
done upon them, that they should have been
holier than other days, even albeit the church
had not appointed them to be kept holy.
Yet Bishop Lindsey would have us believe
that they think them holy, only because of
the church's consecration of them to holy
political uses. But that now, at last, I may
make it appear to all that have common
sense, how falsely (though frequently) it is
given forth by the Bishop, that holidays are
kept by them only for order and policy, and
that they are not so superstitious as to appropriate
the worship to those days, or to
observe them for mystery and as holier than
other days:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 10. First, I require the Bishop to
show us a difference betwixt the keeping of
holidays by Formalists, and their keeping of
the Lord's day; for upon holidays they enjoin
a cessation from work, and a dedicating
of the day to divine worship, even as upon
the Lord's day. The Bishop allegeth five
respects of difference,<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> but they are not true.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, he saith, that the Lord's day is commanded
to be observed of necessity, for conscience
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-130">[pg 1-130]</span><a name="Pg1-130" id="Pg1-130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the divine ordinance as a day sanctified
and blessed by God himself. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
So have we heard from Hooker, that holidays
are sanctified by God's extraordinary
works; but because the Bishop dare not say
so much, therefore I say, 2. This difference
cannot show us that they observe holidays
only for order and policy, and that they place
no worship in the observing of them, as in
the observing of the Lord's day (which is
the point that we require), for worship is
placed in the observing of human as well as
of divine ordinances, otherwise worship hath
never been placed in the keeping of Pharisaical
and popish traditions. This way is
worship placed in the keeping of holidays,
when for conscience of an human ordinance,
they are both kept as holy and thought necessary
to be so kept. 3. The Bishop contradicteth
himself; for elsewhere he defendeth,<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a>
that the church hath power to change
the Lord's day. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></span>, He giveth us this
difference, that the Lord's day is observed
as the Sabbath of Jehovah, and as a day
whereon God himself did rest after the creation.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. This is false of the Lord's day;
for after the creation, God rested upon the
seventh day, not upon the first. 2. Dr Downame
saith,<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> that festival days also are to be
consecrated as Sabbaths to the Lord. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thirdly</span></span>,
The Bishop tells us, that the Lord's day is
observed in memory of the Lord's resurrection.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> He shall never make this good;
for, we observe the Lord's day in memory of
the whole work of redemption. 2. If it were
so, this could make no difference; for just
so Christmas is observed in memory of the
Lord's nativity, Good Friday in memory of
his passion, &amp;c. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fourth</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fifth</span></span> respects
of differences are certain mysteries in the
Lord's day. But we shall see by and by
how his fellow Formalists who are more ingenuous
than himself, show us mysteries in
the festival days also. Lastly, Albeit the
Bishop hath told us that there is no worship
appropriated unto the festival days, which
may not be performed at any other time,
yet this cannot with him make a difference
betwixt them and the Lord's day; for in his
epistle, which I have quoted, he declareth
his judgment to be the same of the Lord's
day, and teacheth us, that the worship performed
on it is not, so appropriated to that
time, but lawfully the same may be performed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-131">[pg 1-131]</span><a name="Pg1-131" id="Pg1-131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at any other convenient time, as the
church shall think fit. Now, as the worship
performed on the Lord's day is appropriated
(in his judgment) to that time, so long as the
church altereth it not, and no longer, just as
much thinks he of the appropriating to festival
days the worship performed on the
same.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 11. 2d. If the holidays be observed
by Formalists only for order and policy,
then they must say the church hath power
to change them. But this power they take
from the church, by saying that they are
dedicated and consecrated to those holy uses
to which they are applied. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Simul Deo dicatum
non est ad usus humanos ulterius
transferendum</span></span>, saith one of the popes.<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a>
And, by the dedication of churches, the
founders surrender that right which otherwise
they might have in them, saith one of
the Formalists themselves.<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a> If, then, the
church hath dedicated holidays to the worship
of God, then hath she denuded herself
of all power to change them, or put them to
another use: which were otherwise if holidays
were appointed to be kept only for order
and policy. Yea, farther, times and
places which are applied to the worship of
God, as circumstances only for outward order
and policy, may be by a private Christian
applied to civil use, for in so doing he
breaketh not the ordinance of the church.
For example, material churches are appointed
to be the receptacles of Christian
assemblies, and that only for such common
commodity and decency which hath place
as well in civil as in holy meetings, and not
for any holiness conceived to be in them
more than in other houses. Now, if I be
standing in a churchyard when it raineth,
may I not go into the church that I may
be defended from the injury of the weather?
If I must meet with certain men for putting
order to some of my worldly affairs,
and it fall out that we cannot conveniently
meet in any part but in the church, may
we not there keep our trust? A material
church, then, may serve for a civil use the
same way that it serveth to an holy use.
And so, for times appointed for ordinary
preaching upon week-days in great towns,
may not I apply those times to a civil use
when I cannot conveniently apply them to
the use for which the church appointeth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-132">[pg 1-132]</span><a name="Pg1-132" id="Pg1-132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them? I trust our prelates shall say, I
may, because they use to be otherwise employed
than in divine worship during the
times of weekly preaching. Now if holidays
were commanded to be kept only for
order and policy, they might be applied to
another use as well as those ordinary times
of weekly meetings in great towns, whereas
we are required of necessity to keep them
holy.

told us before, that they are made holy and

made festival days no less holy in themselves,
and that as the Sabbath was holy
from the beginning, because of God's resting
upon it, and his ordaining of it for an holy
use, howbeit it had never been applied by
men to the exercises of God's worship, even
so festival days are holy, being advanced
truly and worthily by the extraordinary
works of God, and for this cause commended
to all men that honour God to be holier
with them than other days, albeit it should
happen that by us they were never applied
to an holy use. If Bishop Lindsey thinketh
that all this toucheth not him, he may be
pleased to remember that he himself hath
confessed,<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a>

is here, when a man being quiet in his parlour

know them. Look whether they give so
much liberty to others, and take so much to
themselves upon their holidays, for staying
from the public worship and attending
worldly business, as they do at the diets of
weekly and ordinary preaching, yet they
would make the simple believe that their
holidays are only appointed to be kept as
those ordinary times set apart for divine
service on the week-days, nay, moreover, let
it be observed whether or not they keep the
festival days more carefully, and urge the
keeping of them more earnestly than the
Lord's own day. Those prelates that will
not abase themselves to preach upon ordinary
Sabbaths, think the high holidays
worthy of their sermons. They have been
also often seen to travel upon the Lord's
day, whereas they hold it irreligion to travel
upon an holiday. And whereas they can
digest the common profanation of the Lord's
day, and not challenge it, they cannot away
with the not observing of their festivities.

that the five anniversary days are consecrate
to the commemoration of our Saviour, his
benefits being separate from all other ordinary
works, and so made sacred and holidays?
Will he say this much of ordinary
times appointed for weekly preaching? I
trow not. Dr Downame<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> holdeth that we
are commanded, in the fourth commandment,
to keep the feasts of Christ's nativity,
passion, resurrection, ascension, and Pentecost,
and that these feasts are to be consecrated
as sabbaths to the Lord. Bishop
Andrews, a man of the greatest note amongst
our opposites, affordeth us here plenty of
testimonies of the proof of the point in hand,
namely, that the anniversary festival days
are kept for mystery, and as holier than
other days. Simon on Psal. lxxxv. 10, 11,
he saith of Christmas, That mercy and truth,
righteousness and peace, <span class="tei tei-q">“of all the days of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-134">[pg 1-134]</span><a name="Pg1-134" id="Pg1-134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the year meet most kindly on this day.”</span>
Sermon on Psal. ii. 7, he saith of the same
day, That of all other <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hodies</span></span>, we should
not let slip the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hodie</span></span> of this day, whereon the
law is most kindly preached, so it will be
most kindly practised of all others.”</span> Sermon
on Heb. xii. 2, he saith of Good Friday,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let us now turn to him, and beseech him
by the sight of this day.”</span> Sermon on 1 Cor.
v. 7, 8, he saith of the keeping of the
Christian passover upon Easter, That then
<span class="tei tei-q">“it is best for us to do it, it is most kindly
to do it, most like to please Christ, and to
prosper with us. And, indeed, if at any
time we will do it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quando pascha nisi in
pascha, &amp;c.</span></span>, so that without any more ado,
the season pleadeth for this effectually,”</span> &amp;c.
Sermon on Col. iii. 1, he saith, That <span class="tei tei-q">“there
is no day in the year so fit for a Christian to
rise with Christ, and seek the things above,
as Easter day.”</span> Sermon on Job. ii. 19, he
saith, That <span class="tei tei-q">“the act of receiving Christ's
body is at no time so proper, so in season, as
this very day.”</span> Sermon on 1 Cor. xi. 16,
he tells us out of Leo, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is a peculiar
that Easter day hath, that on it all the whole
church obtaineth remission of their sins.”</span>
Sermon on Acts ii. 1-3, he saith of the
feast of Pentecost, That <span class="tei tei-q">“of all days we
shall not go away from the Holy Ghost
empty on this day, it is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dies donorum</span></span> his
giving day.”</span> Sermon on Eph. iv. 30, he
saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the Holy Ghost's day, and
not for that originally so it was, but for that
it is to be intended, ever he will do his own
chief work upon his own chief feast, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">opus diei</span></span>, the day's work upon the day
itself.”</span> Sermon on Psal. lxviii. 18, he saith,
That <span class="tei tei-q">“love will be best and soonest wrought
by the sacrament of love upon Pentecost,
the feast of love.”</span> Sermon on Acts x.
34, 35, he saith, That the receiving of the
Holy Ghost in a more ample measure is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">opus diei</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the proper work of this day.”</span>
Sermon on James i. 16, 17, he calls the gift
of the Holy Ghost the gift of the day of
Pentecost, and tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Holy Ghost,
the most perfect gift of all, this day was, and
any day may be, but chiefly this day, will
be given to any that will desire.”</span> Sermon
on Luke iv. 18, he saith of the same feast,
That <span class="tei tei-q">“because of the benefit that fell on
this time, the time itself it fell on, is, and
cannot be but acceptable, even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eo nomine</span></span>,
that at such a time such a benefit happened
to us.”</span> Much more of this stuff I might
produce out of this prelate's holiday sermons,<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a>

which I supersede as more tedious
than necessary; neither yet will I stay here
to confute the errors of those and such like
sentences of his; for my purpose is only to
prove against Bishop Lindsey, that the festival
days, whereabout we dispute, are not
observed as circumstances of worship, for
order and policy, but that, as the chief
parts of God's worship are placed in the
celebration and keeping of the same, so are
they kept and celebrated most superstitiously,
as having certain sacred and mystical significations,
and as holier in themselves than
other days, because they were sanctified
above other days by the extraordinary works
and great benefits of God which happened
upon them; so that the worship performed
on them is even appropriated to them; all
which is more than evident from those testimonies
which I have in this place collected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, finally, the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Nullity of
Perth Assembly</span></span><a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> proveth this point forcibly:
Doth not Hooker say <span class="tei tei-q">“That the days of
public memorials should be clothed with the
outward robes of holiness? They allege for
the warrant of anniversary festivities, the
ancients, who call them sacred and mystical
days. If they were instituted only for order
and policy, that the people might assemble
to religious exercises, wherefore is there but
one day appointed betwixt the passion and
the resurrection; forty days betwixt the
resurrection and ascension; ten betwixt the
ascension and Pentecost? Wherefore follow
we the course of the moon, as the Jews did,
in our moveable feasts? &amp;c. Wherefore is
there not a certain day of the month kept
for Easter as well as for the nativity?”</span>
&amp;c. That which is here alleged out of
Hooker and the ancients, Bishop Lindsey
passeth quite over it, and neither inserts nor
answers it. As touching those demands
which tie him as so many Gordian knots,
because he cannot unloose them, he goeth
about to break them, telling us,<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a> that they
order these things so for unity with the
catholic church. This is even as some natural
philosophers, who take upon them to give
a reason and cause for all things in nature,
when they can find no other, they flee to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathia physica</span></span>. When it is asked,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-136">[pg 1-136]</span><a name="Pg1-136" id="Pg1-136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wherefore the loadstone doth attract iron
rather than other metal? they answer, that
the cause thereof is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathia physica inter
magnetem et ferrum</span></span>. With such kind of
etymology doth the Bishop here serve us;
yet peradventure he might have given us
another cause. If so, my retractation is,
that if he be excused one way, he must be
accused another way; and if he be blameless
of ignorance, he is blameworthy for dissimulation.
The true causes why those things
are so ordered, we may find in Bishop
Andrew's sermons, which I have made use
of in handling this argument. For example,<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href="#note_504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a>
the reason why there is but one day
betwixt the passion and the resurrection, is,
because that Jonas was but one day in the
whale's belly, and Christ but one day in the
bosom of the earth; for in their going
thither he sets out Good Friday; in their
being there, Easter eve; in their coming
thence, Easter day. As for the fifty days betwixt
Easter and Pentecost, he saith,<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Fifty is the number of the jubilee; which
number agreeth well with this feast, the
feast of Pentecost;—what the one in years,
the other in days;—so that this is the
jubilee as it were of the year, or the yearly
memory of the year of jubilee: that, the
pentecost of years; this, the jubilee of days.”</span>
In the end of the same sermon, he tells us
the reason why there are ten days appointed
betwixt the ascension and Pentecost. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
feast of jubilee (saith he) began ever after
the high priest had offered his sacrifice, and
had been in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sancta sanctorum</span></span>, as this
jubilee of Christ also took place from his
entering into the holy places, made without
hands, after his propitiatory sacrifice, offered
up for the quick and the dead, and for all
yet unborn, at Easter. And it was the
tenth day; and this now is the tenth day
since.”</span> He hath told us also why there is
not a certain day of the month appointed for
Easter,<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a>
as there is for the nativity, namely,
because the fast of Lent must end with that
high feast, according to the prophecy of
Zechariah. Wherefore I conclude, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aliquid
mysterii alunt</span></span>, and so <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aliquid monstri</span></span> too.

to be superstitious; now I will prove
them to be idolatrous. These are different
arguments; for every idolatry is superstition,
but every superstition is not idolatry,
as is rightly by some distinguished.<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href="#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> As for
the idolatry of the controverted ceremonies,
I will prove that they are thrice idolatrous:
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reductive</span></span>, because they are monuments
of by-past idolatry; 2.<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Participative</span></span>, because
they are badges of present idolatry; 3.<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Formaliter</span></span>,
because they are idols themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, then, they are idolatrous, because
having been notoriously abused to idolatry
heretofore, they are the detestable and accursed
monuments, which give no small
honour to the memory of that by-past idolatry
which should lie buried in hell. Dr
Burges<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> reckons for idolatrous all ceremonies
devised and used in and to the honouring of
an idol, whether properly or by interpretation
such. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of which sort (saith he) were
all the ceremonies of the pagans, and not a
few of the Papists.”</span> If an opposite, writing
against us, be forced to acknowledge this
much, one may easily conjecture what enforcing
reason we have to double out our
point. The argument in hand I frame
thus:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All things and rites which have been notoriously
abused to idolatry, if they be not
such as either God or nature hath made to
be of a necessary use, should be utterly
abolished and purged away from divine worship,
in such sort that they may not be accounted
nor used by us as sacred things or
rites pertaining to the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the cross, surplice, kneeling in the
act of receiving the communion, &amp;c., are
things and rites, &amp;c., and are not such as
either God or nature, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore they should be utterly abolished,
&amp;c.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-138">[pg 1-138]</span><a name="Pg1-138" id="Pg1-138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. As for the proposition I shall first
explain it and then prove it. I say, <span class="tei tei-q">“all things
and rites,”</span> for they are alike forbidden, as I
shall show. I say, <span class="tei tei-q">“which have been notoriously
abused to idolatry,”</span> because if the
abuse be not known, we are blameless for
retaining the things and rites which have
been abused. I say, <span class="tei tei-q">“if they be not such
as either God or nature hath made to be of
a necessary use,”</span> because if they be of a necessary
use, either through God's institution,
as the sacraments, or through nature's law,
as the opening of our mouths to speak (for
when I am to preach or pray publicly, nature
makes it necessary that I open my mouth to
speak audibly and articularly), then the
abuse cannot take away the use. I say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“they may not be used by us as sacred
things, rites pertaining to divine worship,”</span>
because without the compass of worship they
may be used to a natural or civil purpose.
If I could get no other meat to eat than the
consecrated host, which Papists idolatrise
in the circumgestation of it, I might lawfully
eat it; and if I could get no other
clothes to put on than the holy garments
wherein a priest hath said mass, I might
lawfully wear them. Things abused to idolatry
are only then unlawful when they are
used no otherwise than religiously, and as
things sacred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. The proposition thus explained
is confirmed by these five proofs: 1. God's
own precept,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall defile also the
covering of thy graven images of silver, and
the ornaments of thy molten images of gold:
thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous
cloth, thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence,”</span>
Isa. xxx. 22. The covering of the idol here
spoken of, Gaspar Sanctus<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a> rightly understandeth
to be that, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo aut induebantur
simulacra Gentilico ritu, aut bracteas quibus
ligneae imagines integantur, aut quo
homines idolis sacrificaturi amiciebantur</span></span>;
so that the least appurtenances of idols are
to be avoided. When the apostle Jude<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href="#note_510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a>
would have us to hate garments spotted with
the flesh, his meaning is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">detestandam essevel
superficiem ipsam mali sive peccati, quam
tunicae appellatione subinnuere videtur</span></span>, as
our own. Rolloke hath observed,<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a> If the
very covering of an idol be forbidden, what
shall be thought of other things which are
not only spotted, but irrecoverably polluted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-139">[pg 1-139]</span><a name="Pg1-139" id="Pg1-139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with idols? Many such precepts were given
to Israel, as <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall destroy their altars,
break their images, and cut down their
groves,”</span> Exod. xxxiv. 13. <span class="tei tei-q">“The graven
images of their gods shall ye burn with
fire: thou shalt not desire the silver nor
gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee,
lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination
to the Lord thy God,”</span> Deut. vii.
25, 26. Read to the same purpose, Num.
xxxiii. 52; Deut. vii. 5; xii. 2, 3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, God hath not only by his precepts
commanded us to abolish all the relics of
idolatry, but by his promises also manifested
unto us how acceptable service this should be
to him. There is a command <span class="tei tei-q">“That the
Israelites should destroy the Canaanites,”</span>
Num. xxxiii. 52, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">evertantque res omnes
idololatricas ipsorum cui mandato</span></span>, saith
Junius,<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subjicitur sua promissio</span></span>, namely,
that the Lord would give them the promised
land, and they should dispossess the inhabitants
thereof, ver. 53; yea, there is a promise
of remission and reconciliation to this
work: <span class="tei tei-q">“By this shall the iniquity of Jacob
be purged, and this is all the fruit to take
away his sin; when he maketh all the stones
of the altar as chalk-stones that are beaten
asunder, the groves and images shall not
stand up.”</span> Isa. xxvii. 9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. Thirdly, The churches of Pergamos
and Thyatira are reproved for suffering
the use of idolothites, Rev. ii. 14-20,
where the eating of things sacrificed to idols
is condemned as idolatry and spiritual adultery,
as Perkins<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> noteth. Paybody, therefore,
is greatly mistaken when he thinks
that meats sacrificed to idols, being the good
creatures of God, were allowed by the Lord,
out of the case of scandal, notwithstanding
of idolatrous pollution; for the eating of
things sacrificed to idols is reproved as idolatry,
Rev. ii.; and the eating of such things
is condemned as a fellowship with devils,
1 Cor. x. 20. Now idolatry and fellowship
with devils, I suppose, are unlawful, though
no scandal should follow upon them. And
whereas he thinks meats sacrificed to idols
to be lawful enough out of the case of scandal,
for this reason, because they are the
good creatures of God, he should have considered
better the Apostle's mind concerning
such idolothites; which Zanchius<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href="#note_514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a> setteth
down thus: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Verum est, per se haec nihil
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-140">[pg 1-140]</span><a name="Pg1-140" id="Pg1-140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
sunt, sed respectu eorum quibut immolantur
aliquid sunt; quia per hoec illis quibus
immolantur, nos consociamur. Qui isti?
Daemones.</span></span> For our better understanding of
this matter, we must distinguish two sorts of
idolothites, both which we find, 1 Cor. x. Of
the one, the Apostle speaks from the 14th
verse of that chapter to the 23d; of the other,
from the 23d verse to the end. This is Beza's
distinction in his Annotations on that
chapter. Of the first sort, he delivers the
Apostle's mind thus: That as Christians have
their holy banquets, which are badges of
their communion both with Christ and
among themselves; and as the Israelites, by
their sacrifices, did seal their copulation in the
same religion, so also idolaters, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cum suis idolis
aut potius daemonibus, solemnibusillis epulis
copulantur</span></span>. So that this sort of idolothites
were eaten in temples, and public solemn
banquets, which were dedicated to the
honour of idols, 1 Cor. viii. 10. Cartwright
showeth<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a> that the Apostle is comparing the
table of the Lord with the table of idolaters;
whereupon it followeth, that as we
use the Lord's table religiously, so that table
of idolaters of which the Apostle speaketh,
had state in the idolatrous worship like that
feast, Num. xxv. 3; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod in honorem falsorum
Deorum celebrabatur</span></span>, saith Calvin.<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href="#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a>
This first sort of idolothites Pareus<a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517" href="#note_517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> calls the
sacrifices of idols; and from such, he saith,
the Apostle dissuadeth by this argument,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Participare epulis idolorum, est idololatria</span></span>.
Of the second sort of idolothites, the
Apostle begins to speak in ver. 23. The
Corinthians moved a question, Whether
they might lawfully eat things sacrificed to
idols? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In privatis conviviis</span></span>, saith
Pareus.<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a>
The Apostle resolves them that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">domi in privato
convictu</span></span>, they might eat them, except
it were in the case of scandal; thus Beza.<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a>
The first sort of idolothites are meant of
Rev. ii., as Beza there noteth; and of this
sort must we understand Augustine<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a>
to mean whilst he saith, that it were better
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mori fame, quam idolothites vesci</span></span>. These
sorts are simply and in themselves unlawful.
And if meats sacrificed to idols be so unlawful,
then much more such things and rites as
have not only been sacrificed and destinated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-141">[pg 1-141]</span><a name="Pg1-141" id="Pg1-141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the honour of idols (for this is but one
kind of idolatrous abuse), but also of a long
time publicly and solemnly employed in the
worshipping of idols, and deeply defiled with
idolatry, much more, I say, are they unlawful
to be applied to God's most pure and
holy worship, and therein used by us publicly
and solemnly, so that the world may
see us conforming and joining ourselves unto
idolaters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. Fourthly, I fortify my proposition
by approved examples; and, first, we
find that Jacob, Gen. xxxv. 4, did not only
abolish out of his house the idols, but their
ear-rings also, because they were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">superstitionis
insignia</span></span>, as Calvin; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">res ad idololatriam
pertinentes</span></span>, as Junius; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monilia idolis
consecrata</span></span>, as Pareus calleth them; all
writing upon that place. We have also the
example of Elijah, 1 Kings xviii. 30: he
would by no means offer upon Baal's altar,
but would needs repair the Lord's altar,
though this should hold the people the longer
in expectation. This he did, in P. Martyr's
judgment, because he thought it a great indignity
to offer sacrifice to the Lord upon
the altar of Baal; whereupon Martyr<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> reprehendeth those who, in administering the true
supper of the Lord, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">uti velint Papisticis vestibus
et instrumentis</span></span>. Further, we have the
example of Jehu, who is commended for the
destroying of Baal out of Israel, with his image,
his house, and his very vestments, 2 Kings x.
22-28. And what example more considerable
than that of Hezekiah, who not only
abolished such monuments of idolatry as at
their first institution were but men's invention,
but brake down also the brazen serpent
(though originally set up at God's own
command), when once he saw it abused to
idolatry? 2 Kings xviii. 4. This deed of
Hezekiah Pope Steven<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a> doth greatly praise,
and professeth that it is set before us for our
imitation, that when our predecessors have
wrought some things which might have been
without fault in their time, and afterward
they are converted into error and superstition,
they may be quickly destroyed by us
who come after them. Farellus saith,<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a> that
princes and magistrates should learn by this
example of Hezekiah what they should do
with those significant rites of men's devising
which have turned to superstition. Yea,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-142">[pg 1-142]</span><a name="Pg1-142" id="Pg1-142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Bishop of Winchester acknowledgeth,<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a>
that whatsoever is taken up at the injunction
of men, when it is drawn to superstition,
cometh under the compass of the brazen
serpent, and is to be abolished; and he excepteth
nothing from this example but only
things of God's own prescribing. Moreover,
we have the example of good Josiah,
2 Kings xxiii., for he did not only destroy
the houses, and the high places of Baal, but
his vessels also, and his grove, and his
altars; yea, the horses and chariots which
had been given to the sun. The example
also of penitent Manasseh, who not only
overthrew the strange gods, but their altars
too, 2 Chron. xxxiii. 15. And of Moses,
the man of God, who was not content to
execute vengeance on the idolatrous Israelites,
except he should also utterly destroy
the monument of their idolatry, Exod. xxxii.
17-20. Lastly, we have the example of
Daniel, who would not defile himself with a
portion of the king's meat, Dan. i. 8; because,
saith Junius,<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> it was converted in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">usum idololatricum</span></span>; for at the banquets of
the Babylonians and other Gentiles, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">erant
praemessa sive praemissa, quoe diis proemittebantur</span></span>,
they used to consecrate their
meat and drink to idols, and to invocate the
names of their idols upon the same, so that
their meat and drink fell under the prohibition
of idolothites. This is the reason
which is given by the most part of the interpreters
for Daniel's fearing to pollute himself
with the king's meat and wine; and it
hath also the approbation of a Papist.<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. Fifthly, Our proposition is backed
with a twofold reason, for things which have
been notoriously abused to idolatry should be
abolished: 1. Quia <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monent. Quia movent.</span></span>
First, then, they are monitory, and preserve
the memory of idols; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monumentum</span></span> in good
things is both <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monimentum</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">munimentum</span></span>;
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monumentum</span></span> in evil things (such
as idolatry) is only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monimentum</span></span>, which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monet
mentem</span></span>, to remember upon such things
as ought not to be once named among saints,
but should lie buried in the eternal darkness
of silent oblivion. Those relics therefore of
idolatry, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quibus quasi monumentis posteritas
admoneatur</span></span> (as Wolphius rightly saith<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a>),
are to be quite defaced and destroyed, because
they serve to honour the memory of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-143">[pg 1-143]</span><a name="Pg1-143" id="Pg1-143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cursed idols. God would not have so much
as the name of an idol to be remembered
among his people, but commanded to destroy
their names as well as themselves,
Exod. xxiii. 13; Deut. xii. 3; Josh. xxiii.
7; whereby we are admonished, as Calvin
saith,<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a>
how detestable idolatry is before God,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cujus memoriam vult penitus deleri, ne
posthac ullum ejus vestigium appareat</span></span>:
yea, he requireth,<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eorum omnium memoriam
deleri, quoe semeldicata sunt idolis</span></span>.
If Mordecai would not give his countenance,
Esth. iii. 2, nor do any reverence to a living
monument of that nation whose name God
had ordained to be blotted out from under
heaven, much less should we give connivance,
and far less countenance, but least of all reverence,
Deut. xxv. 19, to the dead and dumb
monuments of those idols which God hath
devoted to utter destruction, with all their
naughty appurtenances, so that he will not
have their names to be once mentioned or
remembered again. But, secondly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">movent</span></span>
too; such idolothous remainders move us to
turn back to idolatry. For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">usu compertum
habemus, superstitiones etiam postquam explosoe
essent, si qua relicta fuissent earum
monumenta, cum memoriam sui ipsarum
apud homines, tum id tandem ut revocerantur
obtinuisse</span></span>, saith Wolphius,<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> who hereupon
thinks it behoveful to destroy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">funditus</span></span>
such vestiges of superstition, for this cause, if
there were no more: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut et aspirantibus ad
revocandam idololatriam spes frangatur,
et res novas molientibus ansa pariter ac
materia proeripiatur</span></span>. God would have Israel
to overthrow all idolatrous monuments,
lest thereby they should be snared, Deut. vii.
25; xii. 30. And if the law command to
cover a pit, lest an ox or an ass should fall
therein, Exod. xxi. 23, shall we suffer a
pit to be open wherein the precious souls
of men and women, which all the world cannot
ransom, are likely to fall? Did God
command to make a battlement for the roof
of a house, and that for the safety of men's
bodies, Deut. xxii. 8, and shall we not
only not put up a battlement, or object some
bar for the safety of men's souls, but also
leave the way slippery and full of snares?
Read we not that the Lord, who knew what
was in man, and saw how propense he was
to idolatry, did not only remove out of his
people's way all such things as might any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-144">[pg 1-144]</span><a name="Pg1-144" id="Pg1-144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
way allure or induce them to idolatry (even
to the cutting off the names of the idols out
of the land, Zech. xiii. 2), but also hedge up
their way with thorns that they might not
find their paths, nor overtake their idol gods,
when they should seek after them? Hos. ii.
6, 7. And shall we by the very contrary
course not only not hedge up the way of idolatry
with thorns, which may stop and stay
such as have an inclination aiming forward,
but also lay before them the inciting and
enticing occasions which add to their own
propension, such delectation as spurreth forward
with a swift facility?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. Thus, having both explained and
confirmed the proposition of our present argument,
I will make my next for the confutation
of the answers which our opposites devise
to elude it. And, First, They tell us,
that it is needless to abolish utterly things
and rites which the Papists have abused to
idolatry and superstition, and that it is
enough to purge them from the abuse, and

not only things instituted by God are not to

Ans.</span></span> 1. Calvin,<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a> answering that
which Cassander allegeth out of an Italian
writer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abusu non tolli bonum usum</span></span>, he
admits it only to be true in things which are
instituted by God himself, not so in things
ordained by men, for the very use of such
things or rites as have no necessary use in
God's worship, and which men have devised
only at their own pleasure, is taken away by
idolatrous abuse. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pars tutior</span></span> here, is to
put them wholly away, and there is by a
great deal more danger in retaining than in
removing them. 2. The proofs which I have
produced (or the proposition about which now
we debate,) do not only infer that things and
rites which have been notoriously abused to
idolatry should be abolished, in case they be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-145">[pg 1-145]</span><a name="Pg1-145" id="Pg1-145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not restored to a right use, but simply and
absolutely that in any wise they are to be
abolished. God commanded to say to the
covering, and the ornaments of idols, <span class="tei tei-q">“Get
you hence,”</span> Isa. xxx. 22. It is not enough
they be purged from the abuse, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span></span>
they themselves must pack them and
be gone. How did Jacob with the ear-rings
of the idols; Elijah with Baal's altar; Jehu
with his vestments; Josiah with his houses;
Manasseh with his altars; Moses with the
golden calf; Joshua with the temples of
Canaan; Hezekiah with the brazen serpent?
Did they retain the things themselves, and
only purge them from the abuse? Belike,
if these our opposites had been their councillors,
they had advised them to be contented
with such a moderation; yet we see
they were better counselled when they destroyed
utterly the things themselves, whereby
we know that they were of the same
mind with us, and thought that things
abused to idolatry, if they have no necessary
use, are far better away than a-place. Did
Daniel refuse Bel's meat because it was not
restored to the right use? Nay, if that had
been all, it might have been quickly helped,
and the meat sanctified by the word of God
and prayer. Finally, Were the churches of
Pergamos and Thyatira reproved because
they did not restore things sacrificed to idols
to their right use? Or, were they not rather
reproved for having anything at all to
do with the things themselves?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 8. As for that which Dr Forbesse objecteth
to us, we answer, that temples, places
of prayer, chairs, vessels, and bells, are of a
necessary use, by the light and guidance of
nature itself; and matrimonial benediction
is necessary by God's institution, Gen. i. 28;
so that all those examples do except themselves
from the argument in hand. But
the Doctor<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a> intendeth to bring those things
within the category of things indifferent;
and to this purpose he allegeth, that it is
indifferent to use this or that place for a
temple, or a place of prayer; also to use
these vessels, and bells, or others. And of
matrimonial benediction to be performed by
a pastor, he saith there is nothing commanded
in Scripture. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Though it be
indifferent to choose this place, &amp;c., also to
use these vessels or other vessels, &amp;c.; yet
the Doctor, I trust, will not deny that temples,
houses of prayer, vessels and bells, are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-146">[pg 1-146]</span><a name="Pg1-146" id="Pg1-146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a necessary use (which exempteth them
from the touch of our present argument);
whereas, beside that it is not necessary to
kneel in the communion in this place more
than in that place, neither to keep the feast
of Christ's nativity, passion, &amp;c. upon these
days more than upon other days, &amp;c., the
things themselves are not necessary in their
kind; and it is not necessary to keep any
festival day, nor to kneel at all in the act of
receiving the communion. There is also
another respect which hindereth temples,
vessels, &amp;c. from coming within the compass
of this our argument, but neither doth it agree
to the controverted ceremonies. Temples,
houses of prayer, vessels for the ministration
of the sacraments, and bells, are not
used by us in divine worship as things sacred,
or as holier than other houses, vessels,
and bells; but we use them only for natural
necessity,—partly for that common decency
which hath no less place in the actions
of civil than of sacred assemblies; yea,
in some cases they may be applied to civil
uses, as hath been said;<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a>
whereas the controverted
ceremonies are respected and used
as sacred rites, and as holier than any circumstance
which is alike common to civil
and sacred actions, neither are they used at
all out of the case of worship. We see now
a double respect wherefore our argument
inferreth not the necessity of abolishing and
destroying such temples, vessels, and bells,
as have been abused to idolatry, viz. because
it can neither be said that they are
not things necessary, nor yet that they are
things sacred.

way), howbeit for those reasons the retaining
and using of temples which have been
polluted with idols be not in itself unlawful,
yet the retaining of every such temple is not
ever necessary, but sometimes it is expedient,
for farther extirpation of superstition,
to demolish and destroy some such temples
as have been horribly abused to idolatry, Calvin

Whereby I mean to defend (though not as
in itself necessary, yet as expedient <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro
tunc</span></span>,) that which the reformers of the
church of Scotland did in casting down
some of those churches which had been
consecrate to popish idols, and of a long
time polluted with idolatrous worship. As
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-147">[pg 1-147]</span><a name="Pg1-147" id="Pg1-147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the one part the reformers (not without
great probability) feared, that so long as
these churches were not made even with
the ground, the memory of that superstition,
whereunto they had been employed
and accustomed, should have been in them
preserved, and, with some sort of respect,
recognised; so, on the other part, they saw
it expedient to demolish them, for strengthening
the hands of such as adhered to the
reformation, for putting Papists out of all
hope of the re-entry of Popery, and for
hedging up the way with thorns, that the
idolatrously-minded might not find their
paths. And since the pulling down of those
churches wanted neither this happy intent
not happy event, I must say that the bitter
invectives given forth against it, by some
who carry a favourable eye to the pompous
bravery of the Romish whore, and have deformed
too much of that which was by them
reformed, are to be detested by all such as
wish the eternal exile of idolatrous monuments
out of the Lord's land, yet let these
Momus-like spirits understand that their
censorious verdicts do also reflect upon those
ancient Christians of whom we read,<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a> that
with their own hands they destroyed the
temples of idols, and upon Chrysostom, who
stirred up some monks, and sent them into
Phœnicia, together with workmen, and sustained
them on the expences and charges
of certain godly women, that they might
destroy the temples of idols, as the Magdeburgians<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a>
have marked out of Theodoret,
likewise upon them of the religion in France,
of whom Thuanus recordeth, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">templa

expilaverant</span></span>, lastly, upon foreign divines,<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a>

also, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnia idololatria instrumenta</span></span>
should be abolished. Moreover, what was
it else but reason's light which made Cambyses
to fear that the superstition of Egypt
could not be well rooted out if the temples
wherein it was seated were not taken away;
so that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">offensus superstitionibus AEgyptiorum,
Apis cœterorumque Deorum œdes
dirui jubet: ad Ammonis quoque nobilissimum

of retaining idolatrous churches thus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-148">[pg 1-148]</span><a name="Pg1-148" id="Pg1-148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

temples of Baal overthrown, lest they
should return any more to their wonted
use. Wherefore, it appears, that many do
not rightly, who, having embraced the gospel
of the Son of God, yet, notwithstanding,
keep still the instruments of Popery. And
they have far better looked to piety who
have taken care to have popish images, statues
and ornaments, utterly cut off; for, as
we read in the ecclesiastical histories, Constantine
the Great, after he had given his
name to Christ, by an edict provided and
took order that the temples of the idols
might be closed and shut up; but, because
they did still remain, Julian the Apostate
did easily open and unlock them, and thereafter
did prostitute the idols of old superstition
to be worshipped in them,—which Theodosius,
the best and commended prince,
animadverting, commanded to pull them
down, lest they should again any more be
restored.”</span> But because I suppose no sober
spirit will deny that sometimes, and in some
cases, it may be expedient to rase and pull
down some temples polluted with idols,
where other temples may be had to serve
sufficiently the assemblies of Christian congregations
(which is all I plead for), therefore
I leave this purpose and return to Dr
Forbesse.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 10. As touching matrimonial benediction,
it is also exempted out of the
compass of our present argument, because
through divine institution it hath a necessary
use, as we have said. And though the
Doctor, to make it appear that a pastor's
performing of the same is a thing indifferent,
allegeth, that in Scripture there is nothing
commanded thereanent; yet plain it
is from Scripture itself, that matrimonial
benediction ought to be given by a pastor;
for God hath commanded his ministers to
bless his people, Num. vi., which by just
analogy belongeth to the ministers of the
gospel; neither is there any ground for
making herein a difference betwixt them
and the minister of the law, but we must
conceive the commandment to tie both
alike to the blessing of God's people. Unto
which ministerial duty of blessing, because
no such limits can be set as may exclude
matrimonial blessing, therefore they are
bound to the performance of it also. And if
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-149">[pg 1-149]</span><a name="Pg1-149" id="Pg1-149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
farther we consider, that the duty of blessing
was performed by the minister of the
Lord, Heb. vi. 7, even before the law of
Moses, we are yet more confirmed to think,
that the blessing of the people was not commanded
in the law as a thing peculiar and
proper to the Levitical priesthood, but as a
moral and perpetual duty belonging to the
Lord's ministers for ever. Wherefore, notwithstanding
of any abuse of matrimonial
benediction among Papists, yet, forasmuch
as it hath a necessary use in the church, and
may not (as the controverted ceremonies
may) be well spared, it is manifest that it
cometh not under the respect and account of
those things whereof our argument speaketh.

would bear his reader in hand, that in the
judgment of wise reformators, even such
things as have been brought in use by men
only, without God's institution, are not to
be ever taken away, for the abuse which followeth
upon them; let reformators speak
for themselves: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nos quoque priscos ritus,

reformators,—that rights which were both
ancient and lawful, and agreeable to God's
word, were notwithstanding of necessity to
be abolished, because of their superstition
and wicked abuse.

us, that beside the purging of things and rites
abused by idolaters from the idolatrous pollution,
and the restoring of them to a right use,
preaching and teaching against the superstition
and abuse which hath followed upon
them, is another means to avoid that harm
which we fear to ensue upon the retaining of
them. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. This is upon as good ground
pretended for the keeping of images in
churches: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">At inquiunt statim, docemus

It is not enough, with the scribes and Pharisees,
to teach out of Moses' chair what

appearances of evil, are to be taken out of
their sight. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Efficacious enim et plus movent,

purpose.<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> 2. Experience hath taught to
how little purpose such admonitions do serve.
Calvin,<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a> writing to the Lord Protector of
England of some popish ceremonies which
did still remain in that church after the reformation
of the same, desireth that they
may be abolished, because of their former
abuse, in time of Popery. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid enim</span></span>, saith
he, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">illae ceremoniae aliud fuerunt, quam
totidem lenocinia quae miseras animas ad
malum perducerent?</span></span> &amp;c. But because he
saw that some might answer that which our
Formalists answer now to us, and say, it were
enough to warn and teach men that they
abuse not these ceremonies, and that the
abolishing of these ceremonies themselves
were not necessary; therefore immediately
he subjoineth these words: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jam si de cautione
agitur, monebuntur homines scilicet,
ne ad illas nunc impingant, &amp;c. Quis tamen
non videt obdurari ipsos nihilominus,
nihil ut infelici illa cautione obtineri possit.</span></span>
Whereupon he concludes, that if such
ceremonies were suffered to remain, this
should be a means to nourish a greater hardness
and confirmation in evil, and a veil
drawn, so that the sincere doctrine which is
propounded should not be admitted as it
ought to be. In another epistle to
Cranmer,<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a>

that external superstitions were so
corrected in the church of England, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut residui
maneant innumeri surculi, qui assidue
pullulent</span></span>. And what good, then, was
done by their admonitions, whereby they
did, in some sort, send the reviving twigs of
old superstition, since forasmuch as they
were not wholly eradicate, they did still
shoot forth again? If a man should dig a
pit by the way-side, for some commodity of
his own, and thou admonish the travellers to
take heed to themselves, if they go that way
in the darkness of the night, who would hold
him excusable? How then shall they be
excused who dig a most dangerous pit, which
is like to ruin many souls, and yet will have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-151">[pg 1-151]</span><a name="Pg1-151" id="Pg1-151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
us to think that they are blameless, for that
they warn men to beware of it?

these answers which our opposites give get
no place, then shall we use nothing at all
which hath been used by idolaters, and by
consequence, neither baptism nor the Lord's
supper. But let Zanchius answer for us,<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a>
that these things are by themselves necessary,
so that it is enough they be purged
from the abuse. And elsewhere<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> he resolveth,
that things which are by themselves
both good and necessary, may not for any
abuse be put away. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Si vero res sint adiaphorae
sua natura et per legem Dei, eoque
tales quae citra jacturam salutis omitti

fuerunt institutae; si tamen postea videamus
illas in abusus pernitiosos esse conversas;
pietas in Deum, et charitas erga
proximum, postulant ut tollantur, &amp;c.</span></span>
He adds, for proof of that which he saith,
the example of Hezekiah in breaking down
that brazen serpent; which example doth
indeed most pregnantly enforce the abolishing
of all things or rites notoriously abused
to idolatry when they are not of any necessary
use, but it warranteth not the abolishing
of anything which has a necessary use,
because the brazen serpent is not contained
in the number of those things, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quibus carere
non possumus</span></span>, saith Wolphius,<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> answering
to the same objection which presently I have
in hand. Now, that the ceremonies have
not in themselves, nor by the law of God,
any necessary use, and that without hazard
of salvation they may be omitted, is acknowledged
by Formalists themselves; wherefore
I need not stay to prove it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 14. Besides these answers which are
common in our adversaries' mouths, some
of them have other particular subterfuges,
which now I am to search. <span class="tei tei-q">“We must
consider (saith Bishop Lindsey<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a>) the ceremony
itself (dedicated to, and polluted with
idolatry,) whether it be of human or divine
institution. If it be of human institution it
may be removed, &amp;c.; but if the ceremony
be of divine institution, such as kneeling is,—for
the same is commended by God unto
us in his word,—then we ought to consider
whether the abuse of that ceremony hath
proceeded from the nature of the action
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-152">[pg 1-152]</span><a name="Pg1-152" id="Pg1-152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wherein it was used; for if it be so, it ought
to be abolished, &amp;c.; but if the abuse proceed
not from the nature of the action, but
from the opinion of the agent, then, the opinion
being removed, the religious ceremony
may be used without any profanation of
idolatry. For example, the abuse of kneeling
in elevation, &amp;c., proceedeth not only
from the opinion of the agent, but from the
nature of the action, which is idolatrous and
superstitious, &amp;c., and, therefore, both the
action and gesture ought to be abolished.
But the sacrament of the supper, being an
action instituted by God, and kneeling being
of its own nature an holy and religious
ceremony, it can never receive contagion of
idolatry from it, but only from the opinion
of the agent: then remove the opinion, both
the action itself may be rightly used, and
kneeling therein,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Since he
granteth that a ceremony dedicated to and
polluted with idolatry, may (he answereth
not the argument which there he propounded,
except he say must) be abolished, if it
be of human institution, he must grant from
this ground, if there were no more, that the
cross, surplice, kneeling at the communion,
&amp;c., having been so notoriously abused to
idolatry, must be abolished, because they
have no institution except from men only.
But, 2, Why saith he that kneeling is a
ceremony of divine institution? which he
pronounceth not of kneeling, as it is actuated
by some individual case, or clothed with
certain particular circumstances, (for he
maketh this kneeling whereof he speaketh
to be found in two most different actions,
the one idolatrous, the other holy,) but
kneeling in the general, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">praecise
ab omnibus circumstantiis</span></span>. Let him now
tell where kneeling thus considered is commended
unto us in God's word. He would
possibly allege that place, Psal. xcv. 6, <span class="tei tei-q">“O
come, let us worship and bow down: let us
kneel before the Lord our Maker,”</span> which is
cited in the Canon of Perth about kneeling;
but I answer, whether one expounded that
place with Calvin,<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> in this sense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut scilicet
ante arcam faederis populus se prosternat,
quia sermo de legali cultu habetur</span></span>:
whereupon it should follow that it commendeth
only kneeling to the Jews in that
particular case, or whether it be taken more
generally, to commend kneeling (though not
as necessary, yet as laudable and beseeming)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-153">[pg 1-153]</span><a name="Pg1-153" id="Pg1-153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the solemn acts of God's immediate
worship, such as that praise and thanksgiving
whereof the beginning of the psalm
speaketh,—whether, I say, it be taken in
this or that sense, yet it condemneth not
kneeling, except in a certain kind of worship
only. And as for kneeling in the general
nature of it, it is not of divine institution,
but in itself indifferent, even as sitting,
standing, &amp;c., all which gestures are then
only made good or evil when in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">actu exercito</span></span>,
they are actuated and individualised
by particular circumstances. 3. If so be the
ceremony be abused to idolatry, it skills not
how, for, as I have showed before, the reasons
and proofs which I have produced for
the proposition of our present argument,
hold good against the retaining of anything
which hath been known to be abused to
idolatry, and only such things as have a
necessary use are to be excepted. 4. The
nature of an action, wherein a ceremony is
used, cannot be the cause of the abuse of
that ceremony; neither can the abuse of a
ceremony proceed from the nature of the
action wherein it is used, as one effect from
the cause, for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil potest esse homini
causa sufficiens peccati</span></span>, except only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propria
voluntas</span><a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a></span>. 5. The abuse of kneeling in
the idolatrous action of elevation, proceedeth
not from the nature of the action, but from
the opinion of the agent, or rather from his
will, for (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">principium actionum humanarum</span></span>,
is not opinion, but will, choosing that
which opinion conceiteth to be chosen, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas praeunte luce intellectus</span></span>,) it is the
will of the agent only which both maketh
the action of elevation to be idolatrous, and
likewise kneeling in this action to receive
the contagion of idolatry. For the elevation
of the bread <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">materialiter</span></span> is not idolatrous
(more than the lifting up of the bread
among us by elders or deacons, when in
taking it off the table, or setting it on, they
lift it above the heads of the communicants),
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">formaliter</span></span> only, as it is elevated with a
will and intention to place it in state of worship.
So likewise kneeling to the bread
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">materialiter</span></span> is not idolatry (else a man
were an idolater who should be against his
will thrust down and holden by violence
kneeling on his knees when the bread is elevated),
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">formaliter</span></span>, as it proceedeth
from a will and intention in men to give to
the bread elevated a state in that worship,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-154">[pg 1-154]</span><a name="Pg1-154" id="Pg1-154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and out of that respect to kneel before it.
6. What can he gain by this device, that
the abuse of kneeling in the Lord's supper
proceeded not from the nature of the action,
but from the will of the agent? Can he
hereupon infer, that kneeling in that action
is to be retained notwithstanding of any contagion
of idolatry which it hath received?
Nay, then, let him say that Hezekiah did
not rightly in breaking down the brazen
serpent, which was set up at God's command,
and the abuse whereof proceeded not
from the thing itself, which had a most lawful,
profitable, and holy use, but only from
the perverse opinion and will of them who
abused it to idolatry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 15. But the comparing of kneeling
to the brazen serpent is very unsavoury to
the Bishop; and wherefore? <span class="tei tei-q">“The brazen
serpent (saith he), in the time it was abolished,
had no use: that ceased with the
virtue of the cure that the Israelites received
by looking upon it; the act of kneeling
continueth always in a necessary use, for
the better expressing of our thankfulness to
God.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Both kneeling, and all the
rest of the popish ceremonies, may well be
compared to the brazen serpent. And
divines do commonly allege this example, as
most pregnant to prove that things or rites
polluted with idols, and abused to idolatry,
may not be retained, if they have no necessary
use; and I have cited before the
Bishop of Winchester, acknowledging that
this argument holdeth good against all
things which are taken up, not at God's
prescription, but at men's injunction. J.
Rainold<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> argumenteth from Hezekiah's
breaking down of the brazen serpent, to the
plucking down of the sign of the cross. 2.
Why saith he that the brazen serpent, in
the time it was abolished, had no use? The
use of it ceased not with the cure, but it was
still kept for a most pious and profitable use,
even to be a monument of that mercy which
the Israelites received in the wilderness,
and it served for the better expressing of
their thankfulness to God, which the Bishop
here calleth a necessary use. 3. When he
saith that kneeling continueth always in a
necessary use, we must understand him to
speak of kneeling in the act of receiving the
communion; else he runs at random; for it
is not kneeling in the general, but kneeling
in this particular case, which is compared to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-155">[pg 1-155]</span><a name="Pg1-155" id="Pg1-155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the brazen serpent. Now, to say that this
gesture in this action is necessary for our
better expressing of our thankfulness to
God, importeth that the church of Scotland,
and many famous churches in Europe, for so
many years have omitted that which was
necessary for the better expressing of their
thankfulness to God, and that they have not
well enough expressed it. And, moreover,
if kneeling be necessary in the Lord's supper
for our better expressing of our thankfulness
to God, then it is also necessary at
our own common tables. Though we be
bound to be more thankful at the Lord's
table, and that because we receive a benefit
of infinite more worth, yet we are bound to
be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tam grati</span></span>, as well thankful at our own
tables, albeit not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tanta gratitudine</span></span>. If,
then, the same kind of thankfulness be required
of us at our own tables (for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">intentio
et remissio graduum secundum magis et
minus, non variant speciem rei</span></span>,) that which
is necessary for expressing of our thankfulness
at the Lord's table must be necessary
also for the expressing of it at our own.
When I see the Bishop sitting at his table,
I shall tell him that he omitteth the gesture
which is necessary for the expressing of his
thankfulness to God. 4. Did not the apostles'
receiving this sacrament from Christ
himself well enough express their thankfulness
to God? yet they kneeled not, but sat,
as is evident, and shall be afterwards proved
against them who contradict everything
which crosseth them. 5. God will never
take a ceremony of men's devising for a
better expressing of our thankfulness than a
gesture which is commended to us by the
example of his own Son, and his apostles,
together with the celebration of this sacrament
in all points according to his institution.
6. How shall we know where we have
the Bishop and his fellows? It seems they
know not where they have themselves; for
sometimes they tell us that it is indifferent
to take the communion sitting, or standing,
or passing, or kneeling, yet here the Bishop
tells us that kneeling is necessary. 7. I see
the Bishop perceiveth that no answer can
take kneeling at the communion out of the
compass of the brazen serpent, except to say
it hath a necessary use; this is the dead lift,
which yet helpeth not, as I have showed.
All things, then, which are not necessary
(whereof kneeling is one), being notoriously
abused to idolatry, fall under the brazen
serpent.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 16. Paybody also will here talk with
us, therefore we will talk with him too. He
saith,<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> that God did not absolutely condemn
things abused to idolatry, and tells us of three
conditions on which it was lawful to spare
idolatrous appurtenances. 1. If there were
a needful use of them in God's worship. 2.
In case they were so altered and disposed,
as that they tended not to the honour of the
idol, and his damnable worship. 3. If they
were without certain danger of ensnaring
people into idolatry. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Either he requires
all these conditions in every idolothite
and idolatrous appurtenance which may be
retained, or else he thinks that any one of
them sufficeth. If he require all these, the
last two are superfluous; for that which hath
a needful use in God's worship, can neither
tend to the honour of the idol, nor yet can
have in it any danger of ensnaring people
into idolatry. If he think any one of those
conditions enough, then let us go through
them: The first I admit, but it will not help
his cause, for while the world standeth they
shall never prove that kneeling in the act of
receiving the communion, and the other controverted
ceremonies, have either a needful,
or a profitable, or a lawful use in God's worship.
As for his second condition, it is all
one with that which I have already confuted,<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a>
namely, that things abused to idolatry
may be kept, if they be purged from their
abuse, and restored to the right use. But
he allegeth for it a passage of Parker, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of the
Cross</span></span>, cap. 1, sect. 7, p. 10, where he showeth
out of Augustine, that an idolothite may
not be kept for private use, except, 1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Omnis
honor idoli, cum appertessima destructione
subvertatur</span></span>. 2. That not only his
honour be not despoiled, but also all show
thereof. How doth this place (now would
I know) make anything for Paybody? Do
they keep kneeling for private use? Do they
destroy most openly all honour of the idol
to which kneeling was dedicated? Hath their
kneeling not so much as any show of the
breaden god's honour? Who will say so?
And if any will say it, who will believe it?
Who knoweth not that kneeling is kept for
a public, and not for a private use, and that
the breaden idol receiveth very great show
of honour from it? He was scarce of warrants
when he had no better than Parker
could afford him. His third condition rests,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-157">[pg 1-157]</span><a name="Pg1-157" id="Pg1-157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and touching it I ask, what if those idolatrous
appurtenances be not without apparent
danger of ensnaring people into idolatry?
Are we not commanded to abstain from all
appearance of evil? Will he correct the
Apostle, and teach us, that we need not care
for apparent, but for certain dangers? What
more apparent danger of ensnaring people
into idolatry than unnecessary ceremonies,
which have been dedicated to and polluted
with idols, and which, being retained, do
both admonish us to remember upon old
idolatry, and move us to return to the same,
as I have before made evident?<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 17. Now, as for the assumption of
our present argument, it cannot be but evident
to any who will not harden their minds
against the light of the truth, that the ceremonies
in question have been most notoriously
abused to idolatry and superstition, and
withal, that they have no necessary use to
make us retain them. I say, they have been
notoriously abused to idolatry. 1. Because
they have been dedicated and consecrated to
the service of idols. 2. Because they have
been deeply polluted, and commonly employed
in idolatrous worship. For both these
reasons does Zanchius condemn the surplice,<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a>
and such like popish ceremonies left
in England, because the whore of Rome
has abused, and does yet abuse them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad
alliciendos homines ad scortandum. Sunt
enim pompae istae omnes, et ceremoniae Papistisae,
nihil aliud quam fuci meretricii,
ad hoc excogitati, ut homines ad spiritualem
scortationem alliciantur.</span></span> O golden sentence,
and worthy to be engraven with a
pen of iron, and the point of a diamond! for
most needful it is to consider, that those ceremonies
are the very meretricious bravery
and veigling trinkets wherewith the Romish
whore doth faird and paint herself, whilst she
propineth to the world the cup of her fornications.
This makes Zanchius<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a> to call those
ceremonies the relics and symbols of popish
idolatry and superstition. When Queen
Mary set up Popery in England, and restored
all of it which King Henry had
overthrown, she considered that Popery
could not stand well-favoredly without the
ceremonies; whereupon she ordained,<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut

So that not in remote regions, but
in his Majesty's dominions,—not in a time
past memory, but about fourscore years ago,—not
by people's practice only, but by the
laws and edicts of the supreme magistrate,
the ceremonies have been abused to the reinducing
and upholding of Popery and idolatry.
Both far and near, then, both long
since and lately, it is more than notorious
how grossly and grievously the ceremonies
have been polluted with idolatry and superstition.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot choose but marvel much how
Paybody was not ashamed to deny that
kneeling has been abused by the Papists.<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a>
Blush, O paper, which art blotted with such
a notable lie! What will not desperate impudency
dare to aver? But Bishop Lindsey
seemeth also to hold that kneeling hath
been abused by the Papists<a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a> only in the
elevation and circumgestation of the host,
but not in the participation, and that Honorius
did not command kneeling in the participation,
but only in the elevation and circumgestation.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saltem mendacem
oportet essememorem.</span></span> Saith not the Bishop
himself elsewhere of the Papists,<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
sacrament they kneel to the sign,”</span> whereby
he would prove a disconformity between
their kneeling and ours; for we kneel, saith
he, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the sacrament to the thing signified.”</span>
Now if the Papists in the sacrament
kneel to the sign, then they have idolatrously
abused kneeling, even in the participation;
for the Bishop dare not say that, in the elevation
or circumgestation, there is either sacrament
or sign. 2. Why do our divines
controvert with the Papists, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de adoratione
euchuristiae</span></span>, if Papists adore it not in the
participation? for the host, carried about in
a box, is not the sacrament of the eucharist.
3. In the participation, Papists think that
the bread is already transubstantiate into the
body of Christ, by virtue of the words of consecration.
Now, if in the participation they
kneel to that which they falsely conceive to
be the body of Christ (but is indeed corruptible
bread), with an intention to give it
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">latria</span></span> or divine worship, then in the participation
they abuse it to idolatry. But that is
true; therefore, &amp;c. 4. Durand showeth,<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-159">[pg 1-159]</span><a name="Pg1-159" id="Pg1-159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though in the holidays of Easter and Pentecost,
and the festivities of the blessed Virgin,
and in the Lord's day, they kneel not
in the church, but only stand (because of
the joy of the festivity), and at the most do
but bow or incline their heads at prayer,
yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in praesentia corporis et sanguinis
Christi</span></span>, in presence of the bread and wine,
which they think to be the body and blood
of Christ, they cease not to kneel. And
how will the Bishop make their participation
free of this idolatrous kneeling? The
Rhemists show us,<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href="#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> that when they are eating
and drinking the body and blood of our
Lord, they adore the sacrament, and, humbling
themselves, they say to it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Domine non
sum dignus, Deus propitius esto mihi peccatori</span></span>.
5. As for that which Honorius III.
decreed, Dr White calleth it the adoration
of the sacrament,<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> which, if it is so, then we
must say, that he decreed adoration in the
participation itself, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">extra usum sacramenti</span></span>,
the bread cannot be called a sacrament.
Honorius commanded that the
priest should frequently teach his people to
bow down devoutly when the host is elevated
in the celebration of the mass, and that
they should do the same when it is carried
to the sick. All this was ordained in reference
to the participation. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad usum illa instituta
sunt</span></span>, says Chemnitius,<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> speaking of
this decree, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quando scilicet panis consecratur,
et quando ad infirmos defertur, ut
exhibeatur et sumatur</span></span>. So that that which
was specially respected in the decree, was
adoring in the participation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, Here we have to do with Dr
Burges, who will have us to think, that adoration
in receiving the sacrament<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a> hath not
been idolatrously intended to the sacrament
in the church of Rome, neither by decree
nor custom. Not by decree, because albeit
Honorius appointed adoration to be used in
the elevation and circumgestation, yet not in
the act of receiving. And albeit the Roman
ritual do appoint, that clergymen coming
to receive the sacrament do it kneeling, yet
this was done in veneration of the altar,<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a> or
of that which standeth thereupon, and not
for adoration of the host put into their
mouths. Not by custom; for he will not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-160">[pg 1-160]</span><a name="Pg1-160" id="Pg1-160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have it said that kneeling in the time of receiving
was ever in the church of Rome
any rite of or for adoration of the sacrament,
because albeit the people kneel in the act of
receiving, yet I <span class="tei tei-q">“deny (saith he) that they
ever intended adoration of the species, at
that moment of time when they took it in
their mouths, but then turned themselves to
God,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. As for the decree of
Honorius, I have already answered with
Chemnitius, that it had reference specially
to the receiving. 2. When clergymen are
appointed in the Roman ritual to receive
the sacrament at the altar kneeling, this was
not for veneration of the altar, to which
they did reverence at all times when they
approached to it, but this was required particularly
in their receiving of the sacrament,
for adoration of it. Neither is there mention
made of the altar as conferring anything
to their kneeling in receiving the sacrament;
for the sacrament was not used
the more reverently because it stood upon
the altar, but by the contrary, for the sacrament's
sake reverence was done to the altar,
which was esteemed the seat of the body of
Christ. It appeareth, therefore, that the
altar is mentioned, not as concerning the
kneeling of the clergymen in their communicating,
but simply as concerning their
communicating, because none but they were
wont to communicate at the altar, according
to that received canon, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Solis autem ministris
altaris liceat ingredi ad altare et
ibidem communicare</span></span>.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> The one of the
Doctor's own conjectures is, that they
kneeled for reverence of that which stood
upon the altar; but I would know what that
was which, standing upon the altar, made
them to kneel in the participation, if it was
not the host itself? Now, whereas he denies,
as touching custom, that people did
ever intend the adoration of the species, I
answer: 1. How knows he what people in
the Roman church did intend in their
minds? 2. What warrant hath he for this,
that they did not in the participation adore
the host, which was then put into their
mouth? 3. Though this which he saith
were true, he gaineth nothing by it; for put
the case, they did not intend the adoration of
the species, dare he say, that they intended
not the adoration of that which was under
the species? I trow not. Now, that which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-161">[pg 1-161]</span><a name="Pg1-161" id="Pg1-161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was under the species, though in their conceit
it was Christ's body, yet it was indeed
bread; so that, in the very participation,
they were worshipping the bread. But, 4,
What needeth any more? He maketh
himself a liar, and saith plainly,<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> that after
transubstantiation was embraced, and when
all the substance of the visible creature was
held to be gone, they did intend the adoration
of the invisible things, as if there had
been now no substance of any creature left
therein, whereby he destroyeth all which he
hath said of their not intending the adoration
of the species.

Paybody<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> have turned their tongues bravely,
and chosen rather to say anything against
us than nothing. They spare not to answer,
that kneeling hath a necessary use. They
are most certainly speaking of kneeling in
the act of receiving the communion, for
they and their opposites, in those places, are
disputing of no other kneeling but this only.
Now we may easily perceive they are in an
evil taking, when they are driven to such an
unadvised and desperate answer. For, 1.
If kneeling in the act of receiving the Lord's
supper be necessary, why have themselves
too written so much for the indifferency of
it? O desultorious levity that knows not
where to hold itself! 2. If it be necessary,
what makes it to be so? What law? What
example? What reason? 3. If it be necessary,
not only many reformed churches,
and many ancient too, but Christ himself
and his apostles have, in this sacrament,
omitted something that was necessary. 4.
If it be necessary, why do many of their
own disciples take the communion sitting, in
places where sitting is used? What need I
to say more? In the first part of this dispute
I have proved that the ceremonies are
not necessary, in respect of the church's ordinance,
howbeit if it were answered in
this place, that they are in this respect necessary,
it helpeth not, since the argument
proceedeth against all things notoriously
abused to idolatry, which neither God nor
nature hath made necessary. And for any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-162">[pg 1-162]</span><a name="Pg1-162" id="Pg1-162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessity of the ceremonies in themselves,
either our opposites must repudiate what
hath unadvisedly fallen from their pens hereanent,
or else forsake their beaten ground of
indifferency, and say plainly, that the ceremonies
are urged by them, to be observed
with an opinion of necessity, as worship of
God, and as things in themselves necessary.
Look to yourselves, O Formalists, for you
stand here upon such slippery places, that
you cannot hold both your feet.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. It followeth according to the
order which I have proposed, to show next,
that the ceremonies are idolatrous, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">participativè</span></span>.
By communicating with idolaters
in their rites and ceremonies, we ourselves
become guilty of idolatry; even as Ahaz,
2 Kings xvi. 10, was an idolater, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span>,
that he took the pattern of an altar from
idolators. Forasmuch, then, as kneeling
before the consecrated bread, the sign of the
cross, surplice, festival days, bishopping, bowing
down to the altar, administration of the
sacraments in private places, &amp;c., are the
wares of Rome, the baggage of Babylon, the
trinkets of the whore, the badges of Popery,
the ensigns of Christ's enemies, and the
very trophies of antichrist,—we cannot
conform, communicate and symbolise with
the idolatrous Papists in the use of the
same, without making ourselves idolaters by
participation. Shall the chaste spouse of
Christ take upon her the ornaments of the
whore? Shall the Israel of God symbolise
with her who is spiritually called Sodom and
Egypt? Shall the Lord's redeemed people
wear the ensigns of their captivity? Shall
the saints be seen with the mark of the
beast? Shall the Christian church be like
the antichristian, the holy like the profane,
religion like superstition, the temple of God
like the synagogue of Satan? Our opposites
are so far from being moved with these
things, that both in pulpits and private
places they used to plead for the ceremonies
by this very argument, that we should not
run so far away from Papists, but come as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-163">[pg 1-163]</span><a name="Pg1-163" id="Pg1-163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
near them as we can. But for proof of that
which we say, namely, that it is not lawful
to symbolise with idolaters (and by consequence
with Papists), or to be like them in
their rites or ceremonies, we have more to
allege than they can answer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. For, 1st, We have Scripture
for us. <span class="tei tei-q">“After the doings of the land of
Egypt, wherein you dwelt, shall ye not do
and after the doings of the land of Canaan,
whither I bring ye, shall ye not do, neither
shall ye walk in their ordinances,”</span> Lev.
xviii. 3. <span class="tei tei-q">“Take heed to thyself that thou
be not snared by following them, &amp;c., saying,
How did these nations serve their
gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou
shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God,”</span>
Deut. xii. 30. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not do after
their works,”</span> Exod. xxiii. 24. Yea, they
were straitly forbidden to round the corners
of their heads, or to make any cuttings in
the flesh for the dead, or to print any mark
upon them, or to make baldness upon their
heads, or between their eyes, forasmuch as
God had chosen them to be a holy and a
peculiar people, and it behoved them not to
be framed nor fashioned like the nations,
Lev. xix. 27, 28, and xxi. 5, and Deut.
xiv. 1. And what else was meant by those
laws which forbade them to suffer their cattle
to gender with a diverse kind, to sow
their field with diverse seed, to wear a garment
of diverse sorts, as of woollen and linen,
to plough with an ox and an ass together?
Levit. xix. 19, Deut. xxii. 6-11. This
was the hold that people in simplicity and
purity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ne hinc inde accersat ritus alienos</span></span>,
saith Calvin, upon these places. Besides,
find we not that they were sharply reproved
when they made themselves like other nations?
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye have made you priests after
the manner of the nations of other lands,”</span>
2 Chron. xxii. 9. <span class="tei tei-q">“They followed vanity,
and became vain, and went after the heathen
that were round about them, concerning
whom the Lord had charged them, that they
should not do like them,”</span> 2 Kings xvii. 15.
The gospel commendeth the same to us
which the law did to them: <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not ye
unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
and what communion hath light
with darkness? and what concord hath
Christ with Belial? and what agreement
hath the temple of God with idols,”</span> &amp;c.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore, come out from among them,
and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-164">[pg 1-164]</span><a name="Pg1-164" id="Pg1-164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
touch not the unclean thing,”</span> 2 Cor. vi.
14-17. <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man worship the beast,
and his image, and receive his mark in his
forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
drink of the wine of the wrath of God,”</span>
Rev. xiv. 9. And the apostle Jude ver.
12, will have us to hate the very garment
spotted with the flesh, importing, that as
under the law men were made unclean not
only by leprosy, but by the garments, vessels
and houses of leprous men, so do we contract
the contagion of idolatry, by communicating
with the unclean things of idolaters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Before we go further, we will see
what our opposites have said to those Scriptures
which we allege. Hooker saith,<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a> that
the reason why God forbade his people
Israel the use of such rites and customs as
were among the Egyptians and the Canaanites,
was not because it behoved his people
to be framed of set purpose to an utter dissimilitude
with those nations, but his meaning
was to bar Israel from similitude with
those nations in such things as were repugnant
to his ordinances and laws. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
Let it be so, he has said enough against
himself. For we have the same reason to
make us abstain from all the rites and customs
of idolaters, that we may be barred
from similitude with them in such things
as are flatly repugnant to God's word, because
dissimilitude in ceremonies is a bar to
stop similitude in substance, and, on the
contrary, similitude in ceremonies openeth a
way to similitude in greater substance. 2.
His answer is but a begging of that which
is in question, forasmuch as we allege those
laws and prohibitions to prove that all the
rites and customs of those nations were repugnant
to the ordinances and laws of God,
and that Israel was simply forbidden to use
them. 3. Yet this was not a framing of
Israel of set purpose to an utter dissimilitude
with those nations, for Israel used food
and raiment, sowing and reaping, sitting,
standing, lying, walking, talking, trading,
laws, government, &amp;c., notwithstanding that
the Egyptians and Canaanites used so. They
were only forbidden to be like those nations
in such unnecessary rites and customs as had
neither institution from God nor nature, but
were the inventions and devices of men only.
In things and rites of this kind alone it is
that we plead for dissimilitude with the idolatrous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-165">[pg 1-165]</span><a name="Pg1-165" id="Pg1-165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Papists; for the ceremonies in controversy
are not only proved to be under the
compass of such, but are, besides, made by
the Papists badges and marks of their religion,
as we shall see afterwards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. To that place, 2 Cor. vi., Paybody
answereth,<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href="#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a> that nothing else is there
meant, than that we must beware and separate
ourselves from the communion of
their sins and idolatries. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. When the
Apostle there forbiddeth the Corinthians to
be unequally yoked with unbelievers, or to
have any communion or fellowship with idolaters,
and requireth them so to come out
from among them, that they touch none of
their unclean things, why may we not understand
his meaning to be, that not only
they should not partake with pagans in
their idolatries, but that they should not
marry with them, nor frequent their feasts,
nor go to the theatre to behold their plays,
nor go to law before their judges, nor use
any of their rites? For with such idolaters
we ought not to have any fellowship, as
Zanchius resolves,<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a> but only in so far as necessity
compelleth, and charity requireth.
2. All the rites and customs of idolaters,
which have neither institution from God
nor nature, are to be reckoned among those
sins wherein we may not partake with
them, for they are the unprofitable works
of darkness, all which Calvin judgeth to be
in that place generally forbidden,<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a> before
the Apostle descend particularly to forbid
partaking with them in their idolatry. As
for the prohibition of diverse mixtures, Paybody
saith,<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> the Jews were taught thereby to
make no mixture of true and false worship.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. According to his tenets, it followeth
upon this answer, that no mixture is to be
made betwixt holy and idolatrous ceremonies,
for he calleth kneeling a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bodily worship</span></em>,
and a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">worship gesture</span></em>, more than once
or twice. And we have seen before, how
Dr Burges calleth the ceremonies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">worship
of God</span></em>. 2. If mixture of true and
false worship be not lawful, then forasmuch
as the ceremonies of God's ordinance,
namely, the sacraments of the New Testament
are true worship; and the ceremonies
of Popery, namely, cross, kneeling,
holidays, &amp;c., are false worship; therefore,
there ought to be no mixture of them together.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-166">[pg 1-166]</span><a name="Pg1-166" id="Pg1-166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. If the Jews were taught to make
no mixture of true and false worship, then
by the self-same instruction, if there had
been no more, they were taught also to shun
all such occasions as might any ways produce
such a mixture, and by consequence all symbolising
with idolaters in their rites and ceremonies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. As touching those laws which
forbade the Israelites to make round the
corners of their heads, or to mar the corners
of their beards, or to make any cuttings
in their flesh, or to make any baldness between
their eyes, Hooker answereth,<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> that
the cutting round of the corners of the head,
and the tearing off the tufts of the beard,
howbeit they were in themselves indifferent,
yet they are not indifferent being used
as signs of immoderate and hopeless lamentation
for the dead; in which sense it is,
that the law forbiddeth them. To the same
purpose saith Paybody,<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> that the Lord did
not forbid his people to mar and abuse their
heads and beards for the dead, because the
heathen did so, but because the practice
doth not agree to the faith and hope of a
Christian, if the heathen had never used it.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. How much surer and sounder is
Calvin's judgment,<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non aliud fuisse Dei
consilium, quam ut interposito obstaculo
populum suum a prophanis Gentibus dirimiret</span></span>?
For albeit the cutting the hair be
a thing in itself indifferent, yet because the
Gentiles did use it superstitiously, therefore,
saith Calvin, albeit it was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se medium,
Deus tamen noluit populo suo liberum
esse, ut tanquam pueri discerent ex parvis
rudimentis, se non aliter Deo fore gratos,
nisi exteris et proeputiatis essent prorsus
dissimiles, ac longissime abessent ab eorum
exemplis, praesertim vero ritus omnes
fugerent, quibus testata fuerit religio</span></span>. So
that from this law it doth most manifestly
appear, that we may not be like idolaters, no
not in things which are in themselves indifferent,
when we know they do use them superstitiously.
2. What warrant is there for
this gloss, that the law forbiddeth the cutting
round of the corners of the head, and
the matting of the corners of the beard, to
be used as signs of immoderate and hopeless
lamentation for the dead, and that in no
other sense they are forbidden? Albeit the
cutting of the flesh may be expounded to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-167">[pg 1-167]</span><a name="Pg1-167" id="Pg1-167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proceed from immoderate grief, and to be a
sign of hopeless lamentation; yet this cannot
be said of rounding the hair, marring
the beard, and making of baldness, which
might have been used in moderate and
hopeful lamentation, as well as our putting
on of mourning apparel for the dead. The
law saith nothing of the immoderate use of
these things, but simply forbiddeth to round
the head, or mar the beard for the dead;
and that because this was one of the rites
which the idolatrous and superstitious Gentiles
did use, concerning whom the Lord
commanded his people, that they should not
do like them, because he had chosen them
to be a holy and peculiar people, above all
people upon the earth. So that the thing
which was forbidden, if the Gentiles had not
used it, should have been otherwise lawful
enough to God's people, as we have seen out
of Calvin's commentary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. Secondly, We have reason for that
which we say; for by partaking with idolaters
in their rites and ceremonies, we are
made to partake with them in their religion
too. For, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ceremonioe omnes sun quoedam
protestationes fidei</span></span>, saith Aquinas.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> Therefore
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">communio rituum est quasi symbolum

They who did eat of the Jewish sacrifices
were partakers of the altar, 1 Cor. x. 18,
that is, saith Pareus,<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">socios Judaicae religionis

Jews by their sacrifices <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mutuam in una
eademque religione copulationem sanciunt</span></span>,
saith Beza.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a>
Whereupon Dr Fulk noteth,<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a>
that the Apostle in that place doth compare
our sacraments with the altars, hosts, sacrifices
or immolations of the Jews and Gentiles,
<span class="tei tei-q">“in that point which is common to all
ceremonies, to declare them that use them
to be partakers of that religion whereof they
be ceremonies.”</span> If then Isidore thought it
unlawful for Christians to take pleasure in
the fables of heathen poets,<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a> because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non solum
thura offerendo daemonibus immolatur,
sed etiam eorum dicta libentius capiendo</span></span>;
much more have we reason to think
that, by taking part in the ceremonies of
idolaters, we do but offer to devils, and join
ourselves to the service of idols.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-168">[pg 1-168]</span><a name="Pg1-168" id="Pg1-168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. Thirdly, As by Scripture and
reason, so by antiquity, we strengthen our
argument. Of old, Christians did so shun to
be like the pagans, that in the days of Tertullian
it was thought they might not wear garlands,
because thereby they had been made
conform to the pagans. Hence Tertullian
justifieth the soldier who refused to wear a
garland as the pagans did.<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> Dr Mortoune
himself allegeth another case out of Tertullian,<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a>
which maketh to this purpose, namely,
that Christian proselytes did distinguish
themselves from Roman pagans, by casting
away their gowns and wearing of cloaks.
But these things we are not to urge, because
we plead not for dissimilitude with the Papists
in civil fashions, but in sacred and religious
ceremonies. For this point then at
which we hold us, we allege that which is
marked in the third century out of Origen,<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href="#note_590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">590</span></span></a>
namely, that it was held unlawful for Christians
to observe the feasts and solemnities,
either of the Jews or of the Gentiles. Now we find
a whole council determining thus,<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non oportet a Judoeis vel hoereticis, feriatica
quoe mittuntur accipere, nec cum cis
dies agere feriatos.</span></span> The council of Nice
also condemned those who kept Easter upon
the fourteenth day of the month. That
which made them pronounce so (as is clear
from Constantine's epistle to the churches<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a>)
was, because they held it unbeseeming for
Christians to have anything common with
the Jews in their rites and observances.
Augustine condemneth fasting upon the
Sabbath day as scandalous, because the Manichees
used so, and fasting upon that day
had been a conformity with them;<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a> and
wherefore did Gregory advise Leander to
abolish the ceremony of trim-immersion?
His words are plain:<a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quia nunc huc usque
ab hoereticis infans in baptismate tertio
mergebatur, fiendum apud vos esse non
censeo.</span></span> Why doth Epiphanius,<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> in the end
of his books <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contra haereses</span></span>, rehearse all the
ceremonies of the church, as marks whereby
the church is discerned from all other sects?
If the church did symbolise in ceremonies
with other sects, he could not have done so.
And, moreover, find we not in the canons of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-169">[pg 1-169]</span><a name="Pg1-169" id="Pg1-169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

forbidden to deck their houses with green
boughs and bay leaves, to observe the calends
of January, to keep the first day of every
month, &amp;c., because the pagans used to do
so? Last of all, read we not in the fourth
century of the ecclesiastical history,<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href="#note_597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a> that the

be answered to any of these things, by such as
pretend no less than that they have devoted
themselves to bend all their wishes and labours
for procuring the imitation of venerable
antiquity. Yet Hooker can coin a conjecture
to frustrate all which we allege.<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“In things (saith he) of their own nature
indifferent, if either councils or particular
men have at any time with sound judgment
misliked conformity between the church of
God and infidels, the cause thereof hath not
been affectation of dissimilitude, but some
special accident which the church, not being
always subject unto, hath not still cause to
do the like. For example (saith he), in the
dangerous days of trial, wherein there was
no way for the truth of Jesus Christ to triumph
over infidelity but through the constancy
of his saints, whom yet a natural desire
to save themselves from the flame might,
peradventure, cause to join with the pagans
in external customs, too far using the same
as a cloak to conceal themselves in, and a
mist to darken the eyes of infidels withal;
for remedy hereof, it might be, those laws
were provided.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. This answer is altogether
doubtful and conjectural, made up
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peradventure</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it might be</span></em>.
Neither is anything found which can make
such a conjecture probable. 2. The true
reason why Christians were forbidden to
use the rites and customs of pagans, was
neither a bare affectation of dissimilitude,
nor yet any special accident which the church
is not always subject unto, but because it was
held unlawful to symbolise with idolaters in
the use of such rites as they placed any religion
in. For in the fathers and councils
which we have cited to this purpose, there is
no other reason mentioned why it behoved
Christians to abstain from those forbidden
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-170">[pg 1-170]</span><a name="Pg1-170" id="Pg1-170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
customs, but only because the pagans and
infidels used so. 3. And what if Hooker's
divination shall have place? Doth it not
agree to us, so as it should make us mislike
the Papists? Yes, sure, and more properly.
For put the case, that those ancient Christians
had not avoided conformity with pagans
in those rites and customs which we
read to have been forbidden them, yet for
all that, there had been remaining betwixt
them and the pagans a great deal more
difference than will remain betwixt us and
the Papists, if we avoid not conformity with
them in the controverted ceremonies; for
the pagans had not the word, sacraments,
&amp;c., which the Papists do retain, so that we
may far more easily use the ceremonies as a
mist to darken the eyes of the Papists, than
they could have used those forbidden rites
as a mist to darken the eyes of pagans.
Much more, then, Protestants should not be
permitted to conform themselves unto Papists
in rites and ceremonies, lest, in the
dangerous days of trial (which some reformed
churches in Europe do presently feel, and
which seem to be faster approaching to ourselves
than the most part are aware of), they
join themselves to Papists in these external
things, too far using the same as a cloak to
conceal themselves in, &amp;c. 4. We find that
the reason why the fourth council of Toledo
forbade the ceremony of thrice dipping in
water to be used in baptism, was,<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> lest Christians
should seem to assent to heretics who
divide the Trinity. And the reason why
the same council forbade the clergymen to
conform themselves unto the custom of heretics,<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a>
in the shaving off the hair of their
head, is mentioned to have been the removing
of conformity with the custom of heretics
from the churches of Spain, as being a
great dishonour unto the same. And we
have heard before, that Augustine condemneth
conformity with the Manichees, in fasting
upon the Lord's day, as scandalous. And
whereas afterwards the council of Cæsar-Augusta
forbade fasting upon the Lord's day,
a grave writer layeth out the reason of this
prohibition thus:<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“It would appear that
this council had a desire to abolish the rites
and customs of the Manichean heretics, who
were accustomed to fast upon the Lord's
day.”</span> Lastly, we have seen from Constantine's
epistle to the churches, that dissimilitude
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-171">[pg 1-171]</span><a name="Pg1-171" id="Pg1-171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the Jews was one (though not
the only one) reason why it was not thought
beseeming to keep Easter upon the fourteenth
day of the month. Who then can
think that any special accident, as Hooker
imagineth, was the reason why the rites and
customs of pagans were forbidden to Christians?
Were not the customs of the pagans
to be held unbeseeming for Christians, as
well as the customs of the Jews? Nay, if
conformity with heretics (whom Hooker acknowledgeth
to be a part of the visible
church<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a>), in their customs and ceremonies,
was condemned as a scandal, a dishonour to
the church, and an assenting unto their heresies,
might he not have much more thought
that conformity with the customs of pagans
was forbidden as a greater scandal and dishonour
to the church, and as an assenting
to the paganism and idolatry of those that
were without?

they could give a better commendation to
our church, be forced to say, that it doth not

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 11. But our argument is made by
a great deal more strong, if yet further we
consider, that by the controverted ceremonies,
we are not only made like the idolatrous
Papists, in such rites of man's devising
as they place some religion in, but we are
made likewise to take upon us those signs
and symbols which Papists account to be
special badges of Popery, and which also, in
the account of many of our own reverend
divines, are to be so thought of. In the
oath ordained by Pius IV., to be taken of bishops
at their creation (as Onuphrius writeth<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href="#note_625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a>),
they are appointed to swear, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolicas

approbatos ecclesiæ Catholicæ ritus, in
supra dictorum sacramentorum solemni
administratione, recipio, et admitto</span></span>. We
see bishops are not created by this ordinance,
except they not only believe with the church
of Rome, but also receive her ceremonies,
by which, as by the badges of her faith and
religion, cognizance may be had that they
are indeed her children. And farther,
Papists give it forth plainly,<a id="noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> that as the
church hath ever abstained from the observances
of heretics, so now also catholics
(they mean Romanists) are very well distinguished
from heretics (they mean those
of the reformed religion) by the sign of
the cross, abstinence from flesh on Friday,
&amp;c. And how do our divines understand
the mark of the beast, spoken of Rev. xiii.
16, 17? Junius<a id="noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a> comprehendeth confirmation

the sign of the cross to the mark of

mark of the beast the observation of
antichrist's festival days, and the rest of his
ceremonies, which are not commanded by
God. It seems this much has been plain to
Joseph Hall, so that he could not deny it;
for whereas the Brownists allege, that not
only after their separation, but before they
separated also, they were, and are verily
persuaded that the ceremonies are but the
badges and liveries of that man of sin
whereof the Pope is the head and the prelates
the shoulders,—he, in this

demonstrated to be such that their poor
shifts are too weak for gain-standing it.
Some of them (as I touched before) are not
ashamed to profess that we should come as
near to the Papists as we can, and therefore
should conform ourselves to them in their
ceremonies (only purging away the superstition),
because if we do otherwise, we exasperate

are retained by us, and that it is as impossible
to purge the ceremonies from superstition,
as to purge superstition from
itself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are others, who go about to sew a
cloak of fig leaves, to hide their conformity
with Papists, and to find out some difference
betwixt the English ceremonies and
those of the Papists; so say some, that by
the sign of the cross they are not ranked
with Papists, because they use not the material
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-175">[pg 1-175]</span><a name="Pg1-175" id="Pg1-175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cross, which is the popish one, but the
aerial only. But it is known well enough
that Papists do idolatrise the very aerial
cross; for Bellarmine holds,<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">venerabile esse
signum crucis, quod effingitur in fronte,
aere, &amp;c.</span></span> And though they did not make
an idol of it, yet forasmuch as Papists put it
to a religious use, and make it one of the
marks of Roman Catholics (as we have seen
before), we may not be conformed to them
in the use of the same. The fathers of such
a difference between the popish cross and
the English have not succeeded in this their
way, yet their posterity approve their sayings,
and follow their footsteps. Bishop
Lindsey<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635" href="#note_635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">635</span></span></a> by name will trade in the same
way, and will have us to think that kneeling
in the act of receiving the communion, and
keeping of holidays, do not sort us with
Papists; for that, as touching the former,
there is a disconformity in the object, because
they kneel to the sign, we to the thing
signified. And as for the latter, the difference
is in the employing of the time, and in
the exercise and worship for which the cessation
is commanded. What is his verdict,
then, wherewith he sends us away? Verily,
that people should be taught that the disconformity
between the Papists and us is
not so much in any external use of ceremonies,
as in the substance of the service and
object whereunto they are applied. But,
good man, he seeks a knot in the bulrush;
for, 1, There is no such difference betwixt
our ceremonies and those of the Papists, in
respect of the object and worship whereunto
the same is applied, as he pretendeth; for,
as touching the exercise and worship whereunto holidays
are applied, Papists tell us,<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href="#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">636</span></span></a>
that they keep Pasche and Pentecost yearly
for memory of Christ's resurrection, and
the sending down of the Holy Ghost; and, I
pray, to what other employment do Formalists
profess that they apply these feasts, but
to the commemoration of the same benefits?
And as touching kneeling in the
sacrament, it shall be proved in the next
chapter, that they do kneel to the sign, even
as the Papists do. In the meanwhile, it
may be questioned whether the Bishop
meant some such matter, even here where
professedly he maketh a difference betwixt
the Papists' kneeling and ours. His words,
wherein I apprehend this much, are these:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-176">[pg 1-176]</span><a name="Pg1-176" id="Pg1-176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Papists in prayer kneel to an idol,
and in the sacrament they kneel to the
sign: we kneel in our prayer to God, and by
the sacrament to the thing signified.”</span> The
analogy of the antithesis required him to
say, that we kneel <span class="tei tei-q">“in the sacrament”</span> to
the thing signified; but changing his phrase,
he saith, that we kneel <span class="tei tei-q">“by the sacrament”</span>
to the thing signified. Now, if we kneel
<span class="tei tei-q">“by the sacrament to Christ,”</span> then we
adore the sacrament as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">objectum materiale</span></span>,
and Christ as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">objectum formale</span></span>. Just so
the Papists adore their images; because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per
imaginem</span></span>, they adore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prototypon</span></span>. 2.
What if we should yield to the Bishop that
kneeling and holidays are with us applied to
another service, and used with another
meaning than they are with the Papists?
Doth that excuse our conformity with Papists
in the external use of these ceremonies?
If so, J. Hart<a id="noteref_637" name="noteref_637" href="#note_637"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">637</span></span></a> did rightly argument
out of Pope Innocentius, that the church
doth not Judaise by the sacrament of unction
or anointing, because it doth figure and
work another thing in the New Testament
than it did in the Old. Rainold answereth,
that though it were so, yet is the ceremony
Jewish; and mark his reason (which carrieth
a fit proportion to our present purpose),
<span class="tei tei-q">“I trust (saith he) you will not
maintain but it were Judaism for your
church to sacrifice a lamb in burnt-offering,
though you did it to signify, not Christ that
was to come, as the Jews did, but that
Christ is come,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“St. Peter did constrain
the Gentiles to Judaise, when they
were induced by his example and authority
to follow the Jewish rite in choice of meats;
yet neither he nor they allowed it in that
meaning which it was given to the Jews in;
for it was given them to betoken that holiness,
and train them up into it, which Christ
by his grace should bring to the faithful.
And Peter knew that Christ had done this
in truth, and taken away that figure, yea
the whole yoke of the law of Moses; which
point he taught the Gentiles also. Wherefore,
although your church do keep the Jewish
rites with another meaning than God
ordained them for the Jews, &amp;c., yet this
of Peter showeth that the thing is Jewish,
and you to Judaise who keep them.”</span> By
the very same reasons prove we that Formalists
do Romanise by keeping the popish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-177">[pg 1-177]</span><a name="Pg1-177" id="Pg1-177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ceremonies, though with another meaning,
and to another use, than the Romanists do.
The very external use, therefore, of any
sacred ceremony of human institution, is not
to be suffered in the matter of worship,
when in respect of this external use we are
sorted with idolaters. 3. If conformity with
idolaters in the external use of their ceremonies
be lawful, if so be there be a difference
in the substance of the worship and object
whereunto they are applied, then why were
Christians forbidden of old (as we have
heard before) to keep the calends of January,
and the first day of every month, forasmuch
as the pagans used so? Why was
trin-immersion in baptism, and fasting upon
the Lord's day forbidden, for that the heretics
did so? Why did the Nicene fathers
inhibit the keeping of Easter upon the fourteenth
day of the month,<a id="noteref_638" name="noteref_638" href="#note_638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> so much the
rather because the Jews kept it on that
day? The Bishop must say there was no
need of shunning conformity with pagans,
Jews, heretics, in the external use of their
rites and customs, and that a difference
ought to have been made only in the object
and use whereunto the same was applied.
Nay, why did God forbid Israel to cut
their hair as the Gentiles did? Had it not
been enough not to apply this rite to a
superstitious use, as Aquinas showeth<a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href="#note_639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">639</span></span></a> the
Gentiles did? Why was the very external
use of it forbidden?

against us, but we will abide the proof of it,
as of the rest. Nobis saith,<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href="#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saravia, satis

So have some thought to escape by
this postern, that they use the ceremonies,
not for conformity with Papists, but for conformity
with the ancient fathers. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
When Rainold speaketh of the abolishing of popish
ceremonies,<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href="#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a> he answereth this subtlety:
<span class="tei tei-q">“But if you say, therefore, that we
be against the ancient fathers in religion,
because we pluck down that which they did
set up, take heed lest your speech do touch
the Holy Ghost, who saith that Hezekiah
(in breaking down the brazen serpent) did
keep God's commandments which he commanded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-178">[pg 1-178]</span><a name="Pg1-178" id="Pg1-178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Moses,”</span> 2 Kings xviii. 6; and yet
withal saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“That he brake in pieces
the serpent of brass which Moses had
made,”</span> 2 Kings xviii. 4. 2. There are
some of the ceremonies which the fathers
used not, as the surplice (which we have
seen before<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a>) and kneeling in the act of receiving
the eucharist (as we shall see afterwards<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a>).
3. Yielding by concession, not by
confession, that all the ceremonies about
which there is controversy now among us,
were of old used by the fathers; yet that
which these Formalists say, is (as Parker
showeth<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644" href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>) even as if a servant should be covered
before his master, not as covering is a
late sign of pre-eminence, but as it was of
old, a sign of subjection; or as if one should
preach that the prelates are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tyranni</span></span> to their
brethren, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fures</span></span> to the church, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sophistae</span></span> to
the truth, and excuse himself thus: I use
these words, as of old they signified a ruler,
a servant, a student of wisdom. All men
know that words and actions must be interpreted,
used and received, according to their
modern use, and not as they have been of
old.

which I am to evince that they are not only

make Formalists themselves to be formally,
and in respect of their own using of them,
idolaters, consideration not had of the by-past
or present abusing of them by others.
This I will make good: first, of all the ceremonies
in general; then, of kneeling in particular.
And I wish our opposites here look
to themselves, for this argument proveth to
them the box of Pandora, and containeth
that which undoeth them, though this much

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, then, the ceremonies are idols to
Formalists. It had been good to have remembered
that which Ainsworth noteth,<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href="#note_645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a>
that idolothites and monuments of idolatry
should be destroyed, lest themselves at length
become idols. The idolothious ceremonies,
we see now, are become idols to those who
have retained them. The ground which the
Bishop of Winchester taketh for his sermon
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of the worshipping of imaginations</span></span>,—to
wit, that the devil, seeing that idolatrous
images would be put down, bent his whole
device, in place of them, to erect and set up
divers imaginations, to be adored and magnified
instead of the former,—is, in some
things, abused and misapplied by him. But
well may I apply it to the point in hand;
for that the ceremonies are the imaginations
which are magnified, adored, and idolised,
instead of the idolatrous images which were
put down, thus we instruct and qualify:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. First, They are so erected and
extolled, that they are more looked to than
the weighty matters of the law of God: all
good discipline must be neglected before
they be not holden up. A covetous man is
an idolater, for this respect among others,
as Davenant noteth,<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href="#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a> because he neglects the
service which he oweth to God, and is wholly
taken up with the gathering of money. And
I suppose every one will think that those
traditions, Mark vii. 8, 9, which the Pharisees
kept and held, with the laying aside of
the commandments of God, might well be
called idols. Shall we not then call the
ceremonies idols, which are observed with
the neglecting of God's commandments, and
which are advanced above many substantial
points of religion? Idolatry, blasphemy,
profanation of the Sabbath, perjury, adultery,
&amp;c., are overlooked, and not corrected
nor reproved, nay, not so much as discountenanced
in those who favour and follow the
ceremonies; and if in the fellows and favourites,
much more in the fathers. What if
order be taken with some of those abominations
in certain abject poor bodies? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dat
veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas.</span></span>
What will not an episcopal conformist pass
away with, if there be no more had against
him than the breaking of God's commandments
by open and gross wickedness? But
O what narrow notice is taken of non-conformity!
How mercilessly is it menaced!
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-180">[pg 1-180]</span><a name="Pg1-180" id="Pg1-180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
How cruelly corrected! Well, the ceremonies
are more made of than the substance.
And this is so evident, that Dr Burges himself
lamenteth the pressure of conformity,<a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href="#note_647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a>
and denieth not that which is objected to
him, namely, that more grievous penalties
are inflicted upon the refusal of the ceremonies
than upon adultery and drunkenness.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Secondly, Did not Eli make idols
of his sons, 1 Sam. ii. 29, when he spared
them and bare with them, though with the
prejudice of God's worship? And may not
we call the ceremonies idols, which are not
only spared and borne with, to the prejudice
of God's worship, but are likewise so erected,
that the most faithful labourers in God's
house, for their sake, are depressed, the
teachers and maintainers of God's true worship
cast out? For their sake, many learned
and godly men are envied, contemned, hated,
and nothing set by, because they pass under
the name (I should say the nickname) of
puritans. For their sake many dear Christians
have been imprisoned, fined, banished,
&amp;c. For their sake many qualified and
well-gifted men are holden out of the ministry,
and a door of entrance denied to those
to whom God hath granted a door of utterance.
For their sake, those whose faithful
and painful labours in the Lord's harvest
have greatly benefited the church, have been
thrust from their charges, so that they could
not fulfil the ministry which they have received
of the Lord, to testify of the gospel
of the grace of God. The best builders, the
wise master-builders, have been over-turned
by them. This is objected to Joseph Hall by
the Brownists; and what can he say to it?
Forsooth, <span class="tei tei-q">“that not so much the ceremonies
are stood upon as obedience. If God
please to try Adam but with an apple, it is
enough. What do we quarrel at the value
of the fruit when we have a prohibition?
Shemei is slain. What! merely for going
out of the city? The act was little,
the bond was great. What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> commanded
matters not so much as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by whom.</span></em>”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
If obedience be the chief thing stood upon,
why are not other laws and statutes urged
as strictly as those which concern the ceremonies?
2. But what means he? What
would he say of those Scottish Protestants
imprisoned in the castle of Scherisburgh in
France,<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648" href="#note_648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">648</span></span></a> who, being commanded by the captain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-181">[pg 1-181]</span><a name="Pg1-181" id="Pg1-181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to come to the mass, answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“That
to do anything that was against their conscience,
they would not, neither for him
nor yet for the king?”</span> If he approve this
answer of theirs, he must allow us to say,
that we will do nothing which is against our
consciences. We submit ourselves and all
which we have to the king, and to inferior
governors we render all due subjection
which we owe to them, but no mortal
man hath domination over our consciences,
which are subject to one only Lawgiver, and
ruled by his law. I have shown in the first
part of this dispute how conscience is sought
to be bound by the law of the ceremonies,
and here, by the way, no less may be drawn
from Hall's words, which now I examine;
for he implieth in them that we are bound
to obey the statutes about the ceremonies
merely for their authority's sake who command
us, though there be no other thing in
the ceremonies themselves which can commend
them to us. But I have also proved
before that human laws do not bind to obedience,
but only in this case, when the things
which they prescribe do agree and serve to
those things which God's law prescribeth;
so that, as human laws, they bind not, neither
have they any force to bind, but only
by participation with God's law. This
ground hath seemed to P. Bayne<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href="#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a> so necessary
to be known, that he hath inserted
it in his brief <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exposition of the Fundamental
Points of Religion</span></span>. And besides
all that which I have said for it before, I
may not here pass over in silence this one
thing, that Hall himself calleth it superstition
to make any more sins than the ten
commandments.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href="#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a> Either, then, let it be
shown out of God's word that non-conformity,
and the refusing of the English popish
ceremonies, is a fault, or else let us not be
thought bound by men's laws where God's
law hath left us free. Yet we deal more
liberally with our opposites, for if we prove
not the unlawfulness of the ceremonies, both
by God's word and sound reason, let us then
be bound to use them for ordinance' sake.

3. His comparisons are far wide. They are
so far from running upon four feet, that they
have indeed no feet at all, whether we consider
the commandments, or the breach of
them, he is altogether extravagant. God
might have commanded Adam to eat the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-182">[pg 1-182]</span><a name="Pg1-182" id="Pg1-182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apple which he forbade him to eat, and so
the eating of it had been good, the not eating
of it evil; whereas the will and commandment
of men is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regula regulans</span></span>,
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regula regulata</span></span>. Neither can they
make good or evil, beseeming or not beseeming,
what they list, but their commandments
are to be examined by a higher rule. When
Solomon commanded Shemei to dwell at
Jerusalem, and not to go over the brook
Kidron, he had good reason for that which
he required; for as P. Martyr noteth,<a id="noteref_651" name="noteref_651" href="#note_651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">651</span></span></a> he
was a man of the family of the house of
Saul, 2 Sam. xv. 5, and hated the kingdom
and throne of David, so that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">relictus liber
multa fuisset molitus, vel cum Israelitis,
vel cum Palestinis</span></span>. But what reason is
there for charging us with the law of the
ceremonies, except the sole will of the lawmakers?
Yet, say that Solomon had no
reason for this his commandment, except
his own will and pleasure for trying the
obedience of Shemei, who will say that
princes have as great liberty and power of
commanding at their pleasure in matters of
religion as in civil matters? If we consider
the breach of the commandments, he
is still at random. Though God tried Adam
but with an apple, yet divines mark in his
eating of that forbidden fruit many gross
and horrible sins,<a id="noteref_652" name="noteref_652" href="#note_652"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a> as infidelity, idolatry,
pride, ambition, self-love, theft, covetousness,
contempt of God, profanation of God's
name, ingratitude, impostacy, murdering of
his posterity, &amp;c. But, I pray, what exorbitant
evils are found in our modest and
Christian-like denial of obedience to the law
of the ceremonies? When Shemei transgressed
king Solomon's commandment, besides
the violation of this,<a id="noteref_653" name="noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a> and the disobeying
of the charge wherewith Solomon (by
the special direction and inspiration of God)
had charged him, that his former wickedness,
and that which he hath done to David,
might be returned upon his head, the Divine
Providence so fitly furnishing another
occasion and cause of his punishment. There
was also a great contempt and misregard
showed to the king, in that Shemei, knowing
his own evil-deservings, acknowledged
(as the truth was) he had received no small
favour, and therefore consented to the king's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-183">[pg 1-183]</span><a name="Pg1-183" id="Pg1-183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
word as good, and promised obedience. Yet
for all that, upon such a petty and small occasion
as the seeking of two runagate servants,
he reckoned not to despise the king's
mercy and lenity, and to set at nought his
most just commandment. What! Is nonconformity
no less piacular? If any will
dare to say so, he is bound to show that it is
so. And thus have we pulled down the untempered
mortar wherewith Hall would hide
the idolising of the ceremonies.

How much more reason have we to say that
the ceremonies are idols, are set up in God's
stead, since an operative virtue is placed in
them, for giving stay and strength against
sin and tentation, and for working of other
spiritual and supernatural effects? Thus is
the sign of the cross an idol to those who
conform to Papists in the use of it. M. Ant.

we use it) is a mean in some sort to work
our preservation from reproach? Surely the
mind which as yet hath not hardened itself
in sin, is seldom provoked thereunto in any
gross and grievous manner, but nature's secret
suggestion objecteth against it ignominy
as a bar, which conceit being entered into
that place of man's fancy (the forehead), the
gates whereof have imprinted in them that
holy sign (the cross), which bringeth forthwith
to mind whatsoever Christ hath wrought
and we vowed against sin; it cometh hereby
to pass, that Christian men never want a
most effectual, though a silent teacher, to
avoid whatsoever may deservedly procure
shame.”</span> What more do Papists ascribe to
the sign of the cross, when they say, that by
it Christ keeps his own faithful ones<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href="#note_657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contra

sign of the cross an idol who trust by it to
be preserved from sin, shame, and reproach,
and to have their minds stayed in the instant
of tentation. For who hath given
such a virtue to that dumb and idle sign as
to work that which God only can work?
And how have these good fellows imagined,
that not by knocking at their brains, as Jupiter,
but by only signing their foreheads,
they can procreate some menacing Minerva,
or armed Pallas, to put to flight the devil
himself.

is ascribed to the ceremony of confirmation
or bishopping; for the English service
book teacheth, that by it children receive
strength against sin, and against tentation.
And Hooker hath told us,<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> that albeit the
successors of the apostles had but only for a
time such power as by prayer and imposition
of hands to bestow the Holy Ghost,
yet confirmation hath continued hitherto
for very special benefits; and that the fathers
impute everywhere unto it <span class="tei tei-q">“that
gift or grace of the Holy Ghost, not which
maketh us first Christian men, but when we
are made such, assisteth us in all virtue,
armeth us against tentation and sin.”</span> Moreover,
whilst he is a-showing why this ceremony
of confirmation was separated from
baptism, having been long joined with it,
one of his reasons which he giveth for the
separation is, that sometimes the parties
who received baptism were infants, at which
age they might well be admitted to live in
the family, but to fight in the army of God,
to bring forth the fruits, and to do the works
of the Holy Ghost, their time of hability
was not yet come; which implieth, that by
the confirmation men receive this hability,
else there is no sense in that which he saith.
What is idolatry, if this be not, to ascribe to
rites of man's devising, the power and virtue
of doing that which none but He to whom all
power in heaven and earth belongs can do;
and howbeit Hooker would strike us dead
at once, with the high-sounding name of the
fathers, yet it is not unknown, that the first
fathers from whom this idolatry hath descended
were those ancient heretics, the
Montanists. For as Chemnitius marketh out
of Tertullian and Cyprian,<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href="#note_660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a> the Montanists

respect and account is given than God alloweth

excellency is placed than God hath put into

idol exalted against God; which maketh

wrought upon them, to be holier than other
days, what man of sound judgment will not
perceive that these days are idolised, since
such an eminence and excellency is put in

betwixt them and any other days?
We have seen also that the ceremonies are
urged as necessary,<a id="noteref_663" name="noteref_663" href="#note_663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">663</span></span></a> but did ever God allow
that things indifferent should be so highly
advanced at the pleasure of men? And,
moreover, I have shown<a id="noteref_664" name="noteref_664" href="#note_664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a> that worship is
placed in them; in which respect they must
needs be idols, being thus exalted against
God's word, at which we are commanded to
hold us in the matter of worship. Last of
all, they are idolatrously advanced and dignified,

are given them, which are a great deal
more than God's word alloweth in any rites

Now to kneeling in the act of receiving
the Lord's supper, which I will prove to be
direct and formal idolatry; and from idolatry

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. The question about the idolatry
of kneeling betwixt them and us standeth in
this: Whether kneeling, at the instant of
receiving the sacrament, before the consecrated
bread and wine,—purposely placed in
our sight in the act of kneeling as signs
standing in Christ's stead, before which we,
the receivers, are to exhibit outwardly religious
adoration,—be formally idolatry or
not? No man can pick a quarrel at the
stating of the question thus; for, 1. We
dispute only about kneeling at the instant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-186">[pg 1-186]</span><a name="Pg1-186" id="Pg1-186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of receiving the sacramental elements, as
all know. 2. No man denies inward adoration
in the act of receiving, for in our
minds we then adore by the inward graces
of faith, love, thankfulness, &amp;c., by the holy
and heavenly exercise whereof we glorify
God; so that the controversy is about outward
adoration. 3. No man will deny
that the consecrated elements are purposely
placed in our sight when we kneel, except
he say, that they are in that action only
accidentally present before us no otherwise
than the table-cloth or the walls of the
church are. 4. That the sacramental elements
are in our sight (when we kneel) as
signs standing in Christ's stead, it is most
undeniable; for if these signs stand not in
Christ's stead to us, the bread bearing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vicem
corporis Christi</span></span>, and the wine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vicem sanguinis</span></span>,
it followeth, that when we eat the
bread and drink the wine, we are no more
eating the flesh and drinking the blood of
Christ, spiritually and sacramentally, than
if we were receiving any other bread and
wine not consecrated. I stay not now upon
this head, because our opposites acknowledge
it; for Dr Burges<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href="#note_666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a> calls the sacraments the
Lord's images and deputies; and the Archbishop
of Spalato saith,<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href="#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a> that when we take
the sacrament of Christ's body, we adore
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christum sub hac figura figuratum</span></span>. 5.
That kneelers, at the instant of receiving,
have the consecrated bread and wine in the
eyes both of their bodies and minds, as
things so stated in that action, that before
them they are to exhibit outward religious
adoration as well as inward, it is also most
plain; for otherwise they should fall down
and kneel only out of incogitancy, having
no such purpose in their minds, or choice in
their wills, as to kneel before these sacramental
signs.

deny, we affirm. Their negative is
destroyed, and our affirmative confirmed by
these reasons:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, The kneelers worship Christ in or
by the elements, as their own confessions
declare. <span class="tei tei-q">“When we take the eucharist, we
adore the body of Christ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per suum signum</span></span>,”</span>

profess the adoring of Christ in the sacrament.
Dr Mortoune maintaineth such an
adoration in the sacrament as he calleth
relative from the sign to Christ; and Paybody<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href="#note_672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a>
defendeth him herein. But the replier<a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673" href="#note_673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a>
to Dr Mortoune's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Particular Defence</span></span>
inferreth well, that if the adoration be relative
from the sign, it must first be carried
to the sign as a means of conveyance unto
Christ. Dr Burges<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674" href="#note_674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">674</span></span></a> alloweth adoration, or
divine worship (as he calleth it), to be given
to the sacrament respectively; and he allegeth
a place of Theodoret,<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675" href="#note_675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a> to prove that
such an adoration as he there taketh for
divine worship is done to the sacrament in
relation to Christ, and that this adoration
performed to the mysteries as types, is to be
passed over to the archetype, which is the
body and blood of Christ. Since, then,
that kneeling about which our question is,
by the confession of kneelers themselves, is
divine worship given by the sign to the
thing signified, and done to the sacrament
respectively or in relation to Christ, he that
will say that it is not idolatry must acquit the
Papists of idolatry also in worshipping before
their images; for they do in like manner profess
that they adore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prototypon per imaginem,
ad imaginem</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in imagine</span></span>, and that
they give no more to the image but relative
or respective worship. The Rhemists<a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676" href="#note_676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a> tell
us that they do no more but kneel before the
creatures, at, or by them, adoring God. It
availeth not here to excogitate some differences
betwixt the sacramental elements and
the popish images, for what difference soever
be betwixt them when they are considered
in their own natural being, yet as
objects of adoration they differ not, because
when they are considered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in esse adorabili</span></span>,
we see the same kind of adoration is exhibited
by Formalists before the elements
which is by Papists before their images.
To come nearer the point, Papists profess
that they give to the outward signs in the
sacrament no other adoration than the same
which Formalists give to them. Franciscus
à Sancta Clara saith,<a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677" href="#note_677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">677</span></span></a> that divine worship
doth not agree to the signs <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, but only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-188">[pg 1-188]</span><a name="Pg1-188" id="Pg1-188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per accidens</span></span>, and he allegeth for himself
that the Council of Trent, can 6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de euch</span></span>,
saith not that the sacrament, but that Christ
in the sacrament, is to be adored with
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">latria</span></span>. To the same purpose I observe
that Bellarmine<a id="noteref_678" name="noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a> will not take upon him to
maintain any adoration of the sacrament
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">latria</span></span>, holding only that Christ in the
eucharist is to be thus adored, and that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">symbola externa per se et proprie non
sunt adoranda</span></span>. Whereupon he determineth,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">status questionis non est, nisi an
Christus in eucharistia sit adorandus,
cultu latriae</span></span>. Now, albeit Papists understand
by the outward sign of Christ's body in
the eucharist nothing else but the species or
accidents of the bread, yet since they attribute
to the same <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod sub illis accidentibus
ut vocant sit substantialiter corpus
Christi vivum, cum sua Deitate conjunctum</span></span>,<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href="#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a>
and since they give adoration or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">latria</span></span><a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href="#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a> to the species, though not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>,
yet as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quid unum</span></span> with the Body of Christ
which they contain,—hereby it is evident
that they worship idolatrously those very
accidents. And I would understand, if any of
our opposites dare say that Papists commit
no such idolatry as here I impute to them?
Or, if they acknowledge this idolatry of
Papists, how make they themselves clean?
for we see that the worship which Papists
give to the species of the bread is only relative
to Christ, and of the same kind with that
which Formalists give to the bread and
wine.

the bread which is set before us for a
sign to stand in Christ's stead, and before
which we adore whilst it is to us actually an
image representing Christ,<a id="noteref_681" name="noteref_681" href="#note_681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a> is the very bowing
down and worshipping forbidden in the
second commandment. The eucharist is
called by the fathers <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">imago, signum, figura,
similitudo</span></span>, as Hospinian<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a> instanceth out
of Origen, Nazianzen, Augustine, Hilary,
Tertullian, Ambrose. The Archbishop of
Armagh hath also observed,<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href="#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a> that the fathers
expressly call the sacrament an image
of Christ's body, and well might they call
it so, since the sacramental elements do not
only represent Christ to us, but also stand
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-189">[pg 1-189]</span><a name="Pg1-189" id="Pg1-189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in Christ's stead, in such sort that by the
worthy receiving of them we are assured
that we receive Christ himself; and in eating
of this bread, and drinking of this wine,
we eat the flesh, and drink the blood of
Christ spiritually, and by faith. Neither
could the consecrated elements make a sacrament
if they were not such images standing
in Christ's stead. But what needeth
any more? Dr Burges<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a> himself calleth the
sacraments the Lord's images. Now, that
a man who adoreth before the painted or
graven image of Christ, though he profess
that he intendeth his whole adoration to
Christ, and that he placeth the image before
him only to represent Christ, and to
stir up his mind to worship Christ, doth
nevertheless commit idolatry, I trust none
of our opposites will deny. Nay, Bishop
Lindsey teacheth plainly,<a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685" href="#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a> that it is idolatry
to set before the eyes of our minds or bodies
any image as a mean or motive of adoration,
even though the worship should be abstracted
from the image, and not given unto it.
Well, then, will it please him to let us see
that kneeling before the actual images of
Christ's body and blood in the sacrament,
even though these images should be no
otherwise considered in the act of adoration,
but as active objects, motives and occasions
which stir up the mind of the kneeler
to worship Christ (for this is the best face
which himself puts upon kneeling, though
falsely, as we shall see afterward), is not so
great idolatry as the other. All the difference
which he maketh is,<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href="#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that no true
worship can be properly occasioned by an
image, which is a doctor of lies, teaching
nothing of God, but falsehood and vanities;
but the blessed sacrament being instituted
by Christ, to call to our remembrance his
death, &amp;c., gives us, so oft as we receive it,
a most powerful and pregnant occasion of
thanksgiving and praise.”</span> Dr Burges,<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href="#note_687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a>
intermeddling with the same difference-making,
will not have the sacraments, which are
images of God's making and institution, to
be compared with images made by the lust
of men. Two differences, then, are given
us. 1. That the sacramental elements have
their institution from God; images not so.
2. That the sacrament is an occasion of
worship; an image not so. The first difference
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-190">[pg 1-190]</span><a name="Pg1-190" id="Pg1-190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
makes them no help; for though
the ordinance and institution of God makes
the use of sacramental images to be no will-worship,
yet doth it not any whit avail to
show that adoration before them is no idolatry.
May I not commit idolatry with
images of God's institution no less than
with those invented by men, when (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">coeteris
paribus</span></span>) there is no other difference betwixt
them, considered as objects of adoration,
but that of the ordinance and institution
which they have? What if I fall down at
the hearing of a sermon, and religiously adore
before the pastor, as the vicarious sign of
Christ himself, who stands there, in Christ's
stead, 2 Cor. v. 20, referring my adoration to
Christ only, yet in or by that ambassador
who stands in Christ's stead? If this my
adoration should be called so great idolatry
as if I should fall down before a graven
image, to worship God in or by it (for it is,
indeed, as great every way), our kneelers, I
perceive, would permit me to answer for
myself, that my worshipping of God by the
minister cannot be called idolatrous, by this
reason, (because the worshipping of God by
a graven image is such, therefore also the
worshipping of him by a living image is no
other,) since images of God's institution
must not be paralleled with those of men's
invention. As to the second difference, I
answer, 1. Though the Bishop muttereth
here that no true worship can be occasioned
by an image, yet belike he and his fellows
will not stand to it, for many of them allow
the historical use of images; and the Bishop
hath not denied, though his antagonist objecteth
it. Dr Mortoune<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a> plainly alloweth
of images for historical commemoration;
and herein he is followed by Dr Burges.<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a>
2. Whereas he saith that the blessed sacrament
is instituted by Christ to call to our
remembrance his death, this inferreth not
that it is an occasion of thanksgiving and
praise in the very act of receiving, as we
shall see afterward. Our question is only
about kneeling in the act of receiving. 3.
We confess that the sacrament is an occasion
of inward worship in the receiving of
it; for in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eucharistia exercetur summa
fides, spes, charitas, religio, caeteraeque
virtutes, quibus Deum colimus et glorificamus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href="#note_690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a>
But the outward adoration of
kneeling down upon our knees can be no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-191">[pg 1-191]</span><a name="Pg1-191" id="Pg1-191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more occasioned by the blessed sacrament,
in the act of receiving it, than by a graven
image in the act of beholding it. The point
which the Bishop had to prove is, that
whereas an image cannot be the occasion of
outward adoration and kneeling to God before
it in the act of looking upon it, the
sacrament may be, and is, an occasion of
kneeling, when it is set before us in the act
of receiving. This neither he, nor any for
him, shall ever make good.

receiving the sacrament before the vicarious
signs which stand in Christ's stead, and are
purposely set before us in the act of adoration,
that before them we may adore, wanteth
nothing to make up idolatrous co-adoration
or relative worship. Our opposites here
tell us of two things necessary to the making
up of idolatry, neither of which is found in
their kneeling. First, they say, except there
be an intention in the worshipper to adore
the creature which is before his eyes, his
kneeling before it is no idolatry. <span class="tei tei-q">“What
shall I say? saith Paybody.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> What need I
say in this place, but to profess, and likewise
avouch, that we intend only to worship the
Lord our God, when we kneel in the act of
receiving? We worship not the bread and
wine; we intend not our adoring and kneeling
unto them. Give us leave to avouch
our sincerity in this matter, and it will take
away the respect of idolatry in God's worship.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> I showed before, that Paybody
defendeth Dr Mortoune's adoration,
which he calleth relative from the sign to
Chris; yet let it be so, as here he pretendeth,
that no adoration is intended to the
sign; will this save their kneeling from idolatry?
Nay, then, the three children should
not have been idolaters, if they had kneeled
before Nebuchadnezzar's image, intending
their worship to God only, and not to the
image. Our opposites here take the Nicodemites
by the hand. But what saith Calvin?<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a>

have no intention to worship the popish
images when they kneel and worship before

were, shall by this doctrine be no idolaters,
and Paul shall be censured for teaching

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 11. The other thing which our kneelers
require to the making up of idolatry is,
that the creature before which we adore be
a passive object of the adoration; whereas,
say they,<a id="noteref_695" name="noteref_695" href="#note_695"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a> the sacramental elements are <span class="tei tei-q">“no
manner of way the passive object of our adoration,
but the active only of that adoration
which, at the sacrament, is given to Christ;
that is, such an object and sign as moves us
upon the sight, or by the signification thereof,
to lift up our hearts and adore the only
object of our faith, the Lord Jesus; such as
the holy word of God, his works, and benefits
are, by meditation and consideration
whereof we are moved and stirred up to
adore him.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. That which he affirmeth
is false, and out of one page of his own
book I draw an argument which destroyeth
it, thus: If the sacramental elements were
only the active object of their adoration who
kneel before them in the receiving, then
their real presence should be but accidental
to the kneelers. But the real presence of
the elements, in the act of receiving, is not
accidental to the kneelers; therefore, the
proposition I draw from his own words:
<span class="tei tei-q">“We can neither (saith he<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href="#note_696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">696</span></span></a>) pray to God,
nor thank him, nor praise him, but ever
there must be, before the eyes of our minds,
at least something of his works, word, or sacraments,
if not before our external senses.”</span>
He confesseth it will be enough, that these
active objects of worship be before the eyes
of our minds, and that their real presence,
before our external senses, is not necessary
but accidental to us, whose minds are by
their means stirred up to worship. And so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-193">[pg 1-193]</span><a name="Pg1-193" id="Pg1-193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is indeed. For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">esse
scibile</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rememoratiuum</span></span>
of an active object of adoration, is
that which stirreth up the mind to worship,
so that the real presence of such an object is
but accidental to the worshipper. The assumption
I likewise draw out of the Bishop's
own words. For he saith<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a> that we kneel
before the elements, <span class="tei tei-q">“having them in our
sight, or object to our senses, as ordinary
signs, means, and memorials, to stir us up
to worship,”</span> &amp;c. Now if we have them in
our sight and before our senses for this purpose,
that they may be means, signs, and
memorials to stir us up to worship, then,
sure, their being really before our senses,
is not accidental to us when we kneel.
Since Dr Burges<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href="#note_698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a> hath been so dull and sottish
as to write that <span class="tei tei-q">“signs are but accidentally
before the communicants when they
receive,”</span> he is to be ignominiously exsibilat
for making the sacred sacramental signs to
be no otherwise present than the walls of
the church, the nails and timber of the material
table whereupon the elements are set,
or anything else accidentally before the communicants.
But, 2. Put the case, they did
make the elements only active objects of
worship when they kneel in the act of receiving
them. What! Do some Papists
make more of their images when they worship
before them? They hold, as the Archbishop
of Spalato noteth,<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href="#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Imago est

have them to speak for themselves? Suarez

Friar Pedro de Cabrera,<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a> a Spaniard,
taketh the opinion of Durand and his
followers to be this: That images are adored
only improperly, because they put men in
mind of the persons represented by them;
and he reasoneth against them thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“If
images were only to be worshipped by way
of rememoration and recordation, because
they make us remember the samplers which
we do so worship as if they had been then
present, it would follow that all creatures
should be adored with the same adoration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-194">[pg 1-194]</span><a name="Pg1-194" id="Pg1-194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wherewith we worship God, seeing all of
them do lead us unto the knowledge and
remembrance of God.”</span> Whereby it is evident,
that in the opinion of Durand,<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href="#note_702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a> and
those who are of his mind, images are but
active objects of adoration. Lastly, what
saith Becane the Jesuit?<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href="#note_703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">703</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Imago autem
Christi non est occasio idololatriæ apud
nos catholicos, quia non alium ob finem
eam retinemus, quam ut nobis Christum
salvatorem, et beneficia ejus representet.</span></span>
More particularly he will have the image of
Christ honoured for two reasons. 1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quia
honor qui exhibetur imagini, redundat
in eum cujus est imago.</span></span> 2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quia illud in
pretio haberi potest, quod per se revocat
nobis in memoriam beneficia Dei, et est
occasio ut pro eis acceptis grati existamus.
At imago Christi per se revocat nobis in
memoriam beneficium nostræ redemptionis</span></span>,
&amp;c. That for this respect the image of Christ
is honoured, he confirmed by this simile:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quia ob eandem causam apud nos in pretio
ac honore sunt sacra Biblia, itemque
festa paschatis, pentecostes, nativitatis, et
passionis Christi</span></span>. What higher account is
here made of images than to be active objects
of worship? For even whilst it is said
that the honour done to the image resulteth
to him whose image it is, there is no honour
ascribed to the image as a passive object;
but they who honour an image for this respect,
and with this meaning, have it only
for an active object which represents and
calls to their mind the first sampler, as the
Archbishop of Spalato also observeth.<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> Neither
the Papists only, but some also of the
very heathen idolaters, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">norunt in imaginibus
nihil deitatis inesse, meras autem esse
rerum absentium repræsentationes</span></span>,<a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href="#note_705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">705</span></span></a> &amp;c.
And what if neither heathens nor Papists
had been of this opinion, that images are
but active objects of worship? Yet I have
before observed, that the Bishop himself acknowledgeth
it were idolatry to set before
us an image as the active object of our adoration,
though the worship should be abstracted
from the image.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 12. Finally, To shut up this point,
it is to be noted that the using of the sacramental
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-195">[pg 1-195]</span><a name="Pg1-195" id="Pg1-195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
elements, as active objects of worship
only, cannot make kneeling before them
in the receiving to be idolatry; for then
might we lawfully, and without idolatry,
kneel before every active object which stirreth
up our minds to worship God. All the
works of God are such active objects, as the
Bishop also resolveth in the words before
cited. Yet may we not, at the sight of
every one of God's works, kneel down and
adore, whilst the eyes, both of body and
mind, are fixed upon it, as the means and
occasion which stirreth us up to worship
God. The Bishop, indeed, holdeth, we may,
only he saith this is not necessary,<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a>
because when, by the sight of the creatures of God
we are moved privately to worship, our
external gesture of adoration is arbitrary,
and sometimes no gesture at all is required.
But in the ordinary ministry, when the
works of God or his benefits are propounded,
or applied publicly, to stir us up to worship
in the assemblies of the church, then
our gesture ceaseth to be arbitrary; for it
must be such as is prescribed and received
in the church where we worship. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
He shuffleth the point decently, for when
he speaks of being moved to worship at the
sight of any creature, he means of inward
worship, as is evident by these words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sometime
no gesture at all is required;”</span> but
when he speaks of being moved to worship
in the assemblies of the church, by the benefits
of God propounded publicly (for example,
by the blessed sacrament), then he
means of outward worship, as is evident by
his requiring necessarily a gesture. He
should have spoken of one kind of worship
in both cases, namely, of that which is outward;
for of no other do we dispute. When
we are moved by the sacrament to adore
God in the act of receiving, thus can be no
other but that which is inward, and thus we
adore God by faith, hope, and love, though
neither the heart be praying, nor the body
kneeling. That which we deny (whereof
himself could not be ignorant) is, that the
sacramental elements may be to us, in the
receiving, active objects of outward adoration;
or because they move us to worship
inwardly, that therefore we should adore
outwardly. 2. Whereas he teacheth that
kneeling before any creature, when thereby
we are moved to worship privately, is lawful;
but kneeling before the sacramental
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-196">[pg 1-196]</span><a name="Pg1-196" id="Pg1-196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
elements, when thereby we are moved to
worship in the assemblies of the church, is
necessary; that we may kneel there, but we
must kneel here, he knew, or else he made
himself ignorant that both these should be
denied by us. Why, then, did he not make
them good? Kneeling before those active
objects which stir up our hearts to worship,
if it be necessary in the church, it must first
be proved lawful both in the church and
out of it. Now, if a man meeting his lord
riding up the street upon his black horse,
have his heart stirred up to worship God, by
something which he seeth either in himself
or his horse, should fall down and kneel before
him or his horse, as the active object
of his worship, I marvel whether the Bishop
would give the man leave to kneel, and
stand still as the active object before the
man's senses? As for us, we hold that we
may not kneel before every creature which
stirreth up our hearts to worship God;
kneel, I say, whilst the eyes both of body
and mind are fastened upon it as the active
object of our adoration.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 13. The fourth reason whereby I
prove the kneeling in question to be idolatry,
proceedeth thus. Kneeling in the act
of receiving, for reverence to the sacrament,
is idolatry. But the kneeling in question is
such, therefore, &amp;c. The proposition is necessary.
For if they exhibit divine adoration
(such as then kneeling is confessed to be) for
reverence of the sacrament, they do not only
give, but also intend to give, divine adoration
to the same. This is so undeniable
that it dasheth Bishop Lindsey,<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="#note_707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a> and makes
him give a broad confession, that it is idolatry
to kneel at the sacrament for reverence
to the elements. The assumption I
prove from the confession of Formalists.
King Edward's book of Common Prayer
teacheth, that kneeling at the communion
is enjoined for this purpose, that the sacrament
might not be profaned, but held in a
reverent and holy estimation. So doth Dr
Mortoune tell us,<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a> that the reason wherefore
the church of England hath institute
kneeling in the act of receiving the sacrament,
is, that thereby we might testify our
due estimation of such holy rites. Paybody<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a>
makes one of the respects of kneeling
to be the reverent handling and using of
the sacrament. The Bishop of Winchester
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-197">[pg 1-197]</span><a name="Pg1-197" id="Pg1-197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exclaimeth against such as do not kneel, for
not regarding the table of the Lord, which
hath ever been thought of all holies the
most holy, and for denying reverence to
the holy symbols and precious memorials of
our greatest delivery, even the reverence
which is given to prayer. Where, by the
way, I observe, that when we kneel at
prayer it is not to give reverence to prayer,
but to God, whom then most immediately
we adore, so that kneeling for reverence
of the sacrament receiveth no commendation
from kneeling at prayer. The Act of
Perth about kneeling, when Bishop Lindsey
had polished and refined it as well as he
could, ordained us to kneel at the sacrament
in due regard of so divine a mystery.
And what think we is understood by this
mystery, for reverence whereof we are commanded
to kneel? The Bishop<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href="#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a> expoundeth
this mystery to be the receiving of the body
and blood of Christ. But here he either
means the spiritual receiving of the body
and blood of Christ, or the sacramental. If
the spiritual, why did not the Synod ordain
us to kneel in hearing the gospel? for therein
we receive spiritually the body and blood
of Christ, and that as truly and really as in
the sacrament. Whereupon the Archbishop
of Armagh showeth,<a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href="#note_711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">711</span></span></a> that the spiritual and
inward feeding upon the body and blood of
Christ is to be found out of the sacrament,
and that divers of the fathers do apply the
sixth of John to the hearing of the word also,
Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Eusebius, as
Cæsiriensis, and others. Basilius Magnus
likewise teacheth plainly, that we eat the
flesh of Christ in his word and doctrine.
This, I am sure, no man dare deny. The
Bishop, then, must mean by this mystery
the sacramental receiving of the body and
blood of Christ. Now, the sacramental receiving
of the body and blood of Christ, is
the receiving of the sacramental signs of his
body and blood. And as the Archbishop
of Armagh also observeth,<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href="#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a> the substance
which is outwardly delivered in the sacrament,
is not really the body and blood of
Christ. Again he saith,<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a> that the bread
and wine are not really the body and blood
of Christ, but figuratively and sacramentally.
Thus he opposeth the sacramental
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-198">[pg 1-198]</span><a name="Pg1-198" id="Pg1-198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
presence of the body and blood of Christ not
only to bodily, but also to real presence;
and by just analogy, sacramental receiving
of the body and blood of Christ is not only
to be opposed to a receiving of his body and
blood into the hands and mouths of our
bodies, but likewise to the real receiving of
the same spiritually into our souls. It remaineth,
therefore, that kneeling in due regard
of the sacramental receiving of the
body and blood of Christ, must be expounded
to be kneeling in reverence of the
sacramental signs of Christ's body and
blood; and so Perth's canon, and the
Bishop's commentary upon it, fall in with
the rest of those Formalists cited before,
avouching and defending kneeling for reverence
to the sacrament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 14. Those who speak out more
plainly than Bishop Lindsey, do here object
to us, that reverence is due to the sacrament,
and that we ourselves do reverence it
when we sit uncovered at the receiving of it.
But Didoclavius<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> doth well distinguish betwixt
veneration and adoration, because in
civility we use to be uncovered, even to inferiors
and equals, for the regard which we
bear to them, yet do we not worship them
as we worship the king, on our knees.<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a>
As, then, in civility, there is a respect and
reverence different from adoration, so it is
in religion also. Yea, Bellarmine<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a> himself
distinguisheth the reverence which is due to holy
things from adoration. Paybody<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href="#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a> and
Dr Burges<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> will by no means admit this
distinction betwixt veneration and adoration.
But since neither of them hath alleged any
reason against it, I hope they will be weighed
down by the authority of the Archbishop
of Spalato,<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href="#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a> and the Bishop of
Edinburgh,<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href="#note_720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a>
both of whom agree to this distinction. So,
then, we give no adoration at all to the
sacrament, because neither by any outward
or inward action do we perform any worship
for the honour of the same. Burges himself
hath noted to us,<a id="noteref_721" name="noteref_721" href="#note_721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">721</span></span></a> that the first Nicene
council exhorteth that men should not be
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">humiliter intenti</span></span> to the things before them.
We neither submit our minds nor humble
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-199">[pg 1-199]</span><a name="Pg1-199" id="Pg1-199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our bodies to the sacrament, yet do we render
to it veneration,<a id="noteref_722" name="noteref_722" href="#note_722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">722</span></span></a> forasmuch as we esteem
highly of it, as a most holy thing, and
meddle reverently with it, without all contempt
or unworthy usage. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Res profecto
inanimatae</span></span>, saith the Archbishop of Spalato,<a id="noteref_723" name="noteref_723" href="#note_723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">723</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sint sacrae quantum placet, alium
honorem à nobis non merentur, nisi in
sensu negativo</span></span>, as that they be not contemned,
nor unworthily handled. If it be
said that we ought not to contemn the
word, yet hath it not that respect given to
it which the sacrament hath, at which we
are uncovered, so that this veneration given
to the sacrament must be somewhat more
than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">profanatio</span></span>,—I answer, as honour both
in the positive and negative sense, has various
degrees, and according to the more or less immediate
manifestation of divine ordinances
to us, so ought the degrees of our veneration
to be intended or remitted; which is not so
to be understood as if one part of God's sacred
worship were to be less contemned than
another (for none of God's most holy ordinances
may be in any sort contemned), but
that for the greater regard of those things
which are more immediately divine, we
are not in the usage of them, to take to ourselves
so much scope and liberty as otherwise
we may lawfully allow to ourselves in
meddling with such things as are not merely
but mixedly divine, and which are not
from God so immediately as the other, but
more by the intervention of means; and thus
a higher degree of veneration is due to the
sacrament than to the word preached, not
by taking aught from the word, but by adding
more respect to the sacrament than the
word hath. The reason hereof is given to
be this,<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href="#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a> because when we come to the sacrament,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil hic humanum, sed divina omnia</span></span>;
for Christ's own words are, or at least
should be spoken to us when we receive the
sacrament, and the elements also are, by
Christ's own institution, holy symbols of his
blessed body and blood; whereas the word
preached to us is but fixedly and mediately
divine; and because of this intervention of
the ministry of men, and mixture of their
conceptions with the holy Scriptures of God,
we are bidden try the spirits, and are required,
after the example of the Bereans, to
search the Scriptures daily, whether these
things which we hear preached be so or not.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-200">[pg 1-200]</span><a name="Pg1-200" id="Pg1-200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Now we are not in the like sort to try the
elements, and the words of the institution,
whether they be of God or not, because this
is sure to all who know out of Scripture the
first principles of the oracles of God. The
consideration hereof warneth us, that the
sacrament given, according to Christ's institution,
is more merely and immediately divine
than is the word preached; but others
(I hear) object, that if a man should uncover
his head at the sight of a graven image, we
would account this to be an adoring of the
image; and why then shall not we call our
uncovering at the sacrament adoration also?
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Though veneration and adoration be
distinguished in holy things to show that
adoration given to them is idolatry, but
veneration given to them is not idolatry,
yet in profane things, such as images are,
veneration given to them is idolatry, as well
as adoration; and we are idolaters for doing
so much as to respect and reverence them as
things sacred or holy; for, as I touched
before, and as Zanchius evidenceth by sundry
instances,<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href="#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> idolatry is committed when
more estimation is had of anything, more
dignity and excellency placed in it, and more
regard had to it than God alloweth, or than
can stand with God's revealed will; for a
thing thus regarded, though it be not exalted
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut Deus simpliciter</span></span>, yet it is set up <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tanquam
Deus ex parte</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 15. Now Fifthly, If the kneeling
in question be not idolatrously referred to
the sacrament, I demand whereunto is it
specially intended? We have heard the
confession of some of our opposites (and those
not of the smallest note) avouching kneeling
for reverence of the sacrament. Neither can
the mystery spoken of in the Act of Perth
(in due regard whereof we are ordained to
kneel), be any other than the sacrament.
Yet because Bishop Lindsey, and some of
his kind who desire to hide the foul shape of
their idolatry with the trimmest fairding
they can, will not take with the kneeling in
reverence of the sacrament, let them show
us which is the object which they do specially
adore, when they kneel in receiving of
the same; for this their kneeling at this
time ariseth from another respect than that
which they consider in other parts of God's
worship, let two of our prelates tell it out:
Archbishop of St. Andrews would teach out
of Mouline that we ought to adore the flesh
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-201">[pg 1-201]</span><a name="Pg1-201" id="Pg1-201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Jesus Christ in the eucharist;<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a> the Bishop
of Edinburgh also will have us to worship the
flesh and blood of Christ in the sacrament,<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727" href="#note_727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a>
because the humanity of Christ is
there present, being ever and everywhere
joined with the divinity. But a twofold
idolatry may be here deprehended. 1. In
that they worship the flesh and blood of
Christ. 2. In that they worship the same
in the sacrament. As touching the first, albeit
we may and should adore the man Christ
with divine worship, yet we may not adore
his manhood, or his flesh and blood. 1.
Because though the man Christ be God, yet
his manhood is not God, and by consequence
cannot be honoured with divine worship.
2. If adorability agree to the humanity of
Christ, then may his humanity help and
save us: idolaters are mocked by the Spirit
of God for worshipping things which cannot
help nor save them. But the humanity of
Christ cannot save us nor help us, because
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnis actio est suppositi</span></span>, whereas the human
nature of Christ is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">suppositum</span></span>.
3. None of those who defend the adoring of
the humanity of Christ with divine worship,
do well and warrantably express their opinion.
First, some of the schoolmen have
found no other respect wherefore the manhood
of Christ can be said to be adored,<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> except
this, that the flesh of Christ is adored
by him who adores the word incarnate, even
as the king's clothes are adored by him who
adores the king. And thus they make the
flesh of Christ to be adored only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per accidens.
Ego vero</span></span>, saith the Archbishop of
Spalato,<a id="noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non puta a quoquam regis vestimenta
quibus est indutus, adorari</span></span>. And,
I pray, why doth he that worships the king
worship his clothes more than any other
thing which is about him, or beside him,
perhaps a hawk upon his hand, or a little
dog upon his knee? There is no more but
the king's own person set by the worshipper
to have any state in the worship, and therefore
no more worshipped by him. Others
devise another respect wherefore the manhood
of Christ may be said to be worshipped,<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a>
namely, that as divine worship agrees
only to the Godhead, and not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">personis divinis
praecise sumptis</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sub ratione
formali constitutiva personarum quae est
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-202">[pg 1-202]</span><a name="Pg1-202" id="Pg1-202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
relatio</span></span>: but only as these relations <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">identificantur</span></span>
with the essence of the Godhead;
so the manhood of Christ is to be adored
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non per se proecise, sed prout suppositatur
à Deo</span></span>. I answer, if by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">suppositatur</span></span> they
mean (as they must mean) that the manhood
is assumed into the unity of the person of
the Son of God (for otherwise if they mean
that the manhood is made a person, they are
Nestorians), that which they say cannot warrant
the worshipping of the manhood with
divine worship, because the manhood, even
after this assumption and hypostatical union,
and being considered by us as now assumed
into this personal union, is still for all that a
creature, and a distinct nature from the
Godhead (except we will be Eutychians), so
that it cannot yet be said to be worshipped
with divine worship. Dr Field layeth out a
third way;<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> for whilst he admitteth the
phrase of the Lutherans, who say not only
concretively that the man Christ is omnipresent,
but the humanity also, he forgeth a
strange distinction. <span class="tei tei-q">“When we speak (saith
he) of the humanity of Christ, sometimes we
understand only that human created essence
of a man that was in him, sometimes all
that is implied in the being of a man, as
well subsistence as essence.”</span> By the same
distinction would Field defend the attributing
of the other divine properties (and adorability
among the rest) to the human nature.
But this distinction is no better than
if a man should say, by blackness sometimes
we understand blackness, and sometimes
whiteness. Who ever confounded <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abstractum</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concretum</span></span>, before that in Field's
field they were made to stand for one? It
is the tenet of the school, that though in God <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concretum</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abstractum</span></span> differ not, because
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deitas</span></span> are the same, yet
in creatures (whereof the manhood of Christ
is one) they are really differenced. For
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concretum</span></span> signifieth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aliquid completum
subsistens</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abstractum</span></span> (such as humanity)
signifieth<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> something, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non ut subsistens,
sed in quo aliquid est</span></span>, as whiteness
doth not signify that thing which is white,
but that whereby it is white. How comes
it then that Field makes humanity, in the
abstract, to have a subsistence? Antonius
Sadeel censures Turrianus<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a> for saying that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">albedo cum pariete, idem est atque paries
albus</span></span>: his reason is, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">albedo dicitur
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-203">[pg 1-203]</span><a name="Pg1-203" id="Pg1-203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
esse, non cum pariete sed in pariete.</span></span> An
abstract is no more an abstract if it have a
subsistence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is yet a fourth sense remaining,
which is Augustine's, and theirs who speak
with him. His sentence which our opposites
cite for them is, that it is sin not to
adore the flesh of Christ, howbeit very erroneously
he groundeth that which he saith
upon those words of the psalm, <span class="tei tei-q">“Worship
at his footstool,”</span> taking this footstool to be
the flesh of Christ. Yet that his meaning
was better than his expression, and that he
meant not that adoration should be given to
the flesh of Christ, but to the Godhead, whose
footstool the flesh is, it is plain from those
words which Burges himself citeth out of
him:<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“To whatsoever earth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
flesh of Christ, thou bowest and prostrate thyself,
look not on it as earth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as flesh; but
look at that Holy One whose footstool is
that thou dost adore, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, look to the Godhead
of Christ, whose flesh thou dost adore
in the mysteries.”</span> Wherefore if we would
give any sound sense to their words who
say that the flesh of Christ is to be adored,
we must note with A. Polanus,<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cum
dicitur carnem Christi adorari, non est
propria sed figurata enunciatio; quia non
adoratur proprie caro secundum se, quia
creatura est, sed Deus in carne manifestatis,
seu Deus carne vestitus</span></span>. But two
things I will here advertise my reader of.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. That though this form of speaking,
which saith that the flesh of Christ is to be
adored, being thus expounded, receiveth a
sound sense, yet the expression is very bad,
and violence is done to the phrase when
such a meaning is drawn out of it. For how
can we, by the flesh of Christ, understand
his Godhead? The communion of properties
admitteth us to put the man Christ for
God, but not his manhood. And Hooker
teacheth rightly,<a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that by force of union,
the properties of both natures (and by consequence,
adorability, which is a property of
the divine nature) are imputed to the person
only in whom they are, and not what
belongeth to the one nature really conveyed
or translated into the other.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Yet our kneelers who say they adore
the flesh of Christ in the sacrament, have
no such orthodox (though forced) meaning
whereby to expound themselves. For Bishop
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-204">[pg 1-204]</span><a name="Pg1-204" id="Pg1-204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lindsey will have us,<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href="#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a> in receiving the
sacrament, to bow our knees and adore the
humanity of Christ, by reason of the personal
union that it hath with the Godhead;
therefore he means that we should, and
may adore with divine worship, that which
is personally united with the Godhead.
And what is that? Not the Godhead
sure, but the created nature of the manhood
(which not being God but a creature
only, cannot without idolatry be worshipped
with divine worship). I conclude, therefore,
that by the flesh of Christ, which he
will have to be adored in the sacrament, he
understands not the Godhead, as Augustine
doth, but that created nature which is united
with the Godhead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 16. But, Secondly, As we have seen
what is to be thought of worshipping the
flesh of Christ, so let us next consider what
may be thought of worshipping his flesh in
the sacrament; for this was the other head
which I proposed. Now, they who worship
the flesh of Christ in the sacrament, must
either consider it as present in the sacrament,
and in that respect to be adored, because
of the personal union of it with the
word, or else because of the sacramental
union of it with the outward sign, which is
a respect supervenient to that of the ubiquity
of it in the person of the word. First,
then, touching the former of those respects,
the personal union of the flesh with the
word can neither infer the presence of the
flesh in the sacrament to those who worthily
receive, nor yet can it make anything
for the adoration of the flesh. Not the
former; for in respect of the ubiquity of the
flesh in the person of the word, it is ever and
alike present with the communicants, whether
they receive worthily or not, and with the
bread and wine, whether they be consecrated
to be the signs of his body and blood or not.
Therefore divines rightly hold <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">praesentiam
corporis Christi in caena, non ab ubiquitate,
sed à verbis Christi pendere</span></span>.<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href="#note_738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> Not
the latter neither; for (as I have showed
already) notwithstanding of the personal
union, yet the flesh of Christ remaineth a
creature, and is not God, and so cannot at
all be worshipped with divine worship. And
if his flesh, could be at all so worshipped,<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-205">[pg 1-205]</span><a name="Pg1-205" id="Pg1-205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet were there no reason for worshipping it
in the sacrament (in respect of its personal
union with the word) more than in all other
actions, and at all other times, for ever and
always is the flesh of Christ personally united
with the word, and in that respect present
to us. There remaineth therefore nothing
but that other respect of the sacramental
union of the flesh of Christ with the sacramental
sign, which they can have for worshipping
his flesh in the sacrament. Whereas
Bishop Lindsey saith,<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that it is no error
to believe the spiritual, powerful, and
personal presence of Christ's body at the
sacrament, and in that respect to worship
his flesh and blood there,”</span>—he means, sure,
some special respect, for which it may be
said that Christ's body is present at the sacrament
(so as it is not present out of the
sacrament), and in that respect to be there
adored. Now Christ's body is spiritually and
powerfully present to us in the word (as I
showed before), yea, as often as looking by
faith upon his body broken and blood shed
for us, we receive the sense and assurance
of the remission of our sins through his merits,
and as for this personal presence of
Christ's body which he speaketh of, I have
showed also that the adoring of the flesh
of Christ in the sacrament cannot be inferred
upon it, wherefore he can tell us nothing
which may be thought to infer the
presence of Christ's flesh in the sacrament,
and the adoration of it in that respect, save
only the sacramental union of it with the
outward sign. Now adoration in this respect,
and for this reason, must suppose the
bodily presence of Christ's flesh in the sacrament.
Whereupon the Archbishop of Spalato
saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the Papists adore the body
of Christ in the sacrament, only because of
the supposition of the bodily presence of it,
and if they knew that the true body of
Christ is not under the species of the bread
and wine, they would exhibit no adoration.”</span>
And elsewhere he showeth,<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> that the mystery
of the eucharist cannot make the
manhood of Christ to be adored, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quia in
pane corporalis Christi praesentia non
est</span></span> implying, that if the flesh of Christ be
adored in respect of the mystery of the eucharist,
then must it be bodily present in
the sign, which is false, and hereupon he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-206">[pg 1-206]</span><a name="Pg1-206" id="Pg1-206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gathereth truly, that it cannot be adored in
respect of the mystery of the eucharist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further, It is to be remembered (which
I have also before noted out of Dr Usher<a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href="#note_742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a>)
that the sacramental presence of the body of
Christ, or that presence of it which is inferred
upon that sacramental union which is
betwixt it and the outward sign, is not the
real or spiritual presence of it (for in this
manner it is present to us out of the sacrament,
even as oft as by faith we apprehend
it and the virtue thereof); but it is figuratively
only so called, the sense being this,
that the body of Christ is present and given
to us in the sacrament, meaning by his body,
the sign of his body. These things being so,
whosoever worshippeth Christ's body in the
eucharist, and that in respect of the sacramental
presence of it in the same, cannot
choose but hold that Christ's body is bodily
and really under the species of the bread,
and so fall into the idolatry of bread-worship;
or else our divines<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> have not rightly
convinced the Papists, as idolatrous worshippers
of the bread in the eucharist, forasmuch
as they attribute to it that which it is
not, nor hath not, to wit, that under the
accidents thereof is contained substantially
the true and living body of Christ, joined
and united to his Godhead. What can
Bishop Lindsey now answer for himself,
except he say with one of his brethren,<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href="#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a>
that we should adore the flesh of Christ in
the sacrament, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">corporalis praesentia
Christi, sed non modo corporalis, comitatur
sacramentum eucharistiae</span></span>. And
Christ is there present <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">corporaliter, modo
spirituali</span></span>? But this man contradicts himself
miserably; for we had him a little before
acknowledging that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in pane corporalis
Christi praesentia non est</span></span>. How shall we
then reconcile him with himself? He would
say that Christ is not bodily present in the
sacrament after a bodily manner, but he is
bodily present after a spiritual manner. Why
should I blot paper with such a vanity,
which implieth a contradiction, bodily and
not bodily, spiritually and not spiritually.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 17. The sixth and last argument
whereby I prove the kneeling in question
to be idolatry, is taken from the nature and
kind of the worship wherein it is used. For
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-207">[pg 1-207]</span><a name="Pg1-207" id="Pg1-207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the receiving of the sacrament being a mediate
worship of God, wherein the elements
come between God and us, in such sort that
they belong to the substance of the worship
(for without the elements, the sacrament is
not a sacrament), and withal are susceptive
of co-adoration, forasmuch as in the act of
receiving, both our minds and our external
senses are, and should be, fastened upon
them, hereby we evince the idolatry of
kneeling in the receiving. For in every
mediate worship, wherein some creature is
purposely set between God and us to have
state in the same, it is idolatry to kneel before
such a creature, whilst both our minds
and senses are fastened upon it. Our opposites
have talked many things together to
infringe this argument. First, They allege
the bowing of God's people before the ark,<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href="#note_745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a>
the temple, the holy mountain, the altar,
the bush, the cloud, the fire which came
from heaven. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Where they have
read that the people bowed before the altar
of God, I know not. Bishop Lindsey indeed
would prove<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href="#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> from 2 Chron vi. 12,
13, and Mich. vi. 6, that the people bowed
before the altar and the offering. But the
first of those places speaks nothing of kneeling
before the altar, but only of kneeling
before the congregation, that is, in the sight
of the congregation. And if Solomon had
then kneeled before the altar, yet the altar
had been but occasionally and accidentally
before him in his adoration, for to what end
and use could he have purposely set the
altar before him, whilst he was kneeling and
praying? The place of Micah cannot prove
that God's people did kneel before the offerings
at all (for it speaks only of bowing before
God), far less, that they kneeled before
them in the very act of offering, and that
with their minds and senses fixed upon
them, as we kneel in the very act of receiving
the sacrament, and that at that instant
when our minds and senses are fastened
upon the signs, that we may discern the
things signified by them, for the exercising
of our hearts in a thankful meditation upon
the Lord's death. 2. As for the other examples
here alleged, God was immediately
present, in and with the ark, the temple,
the holy mountain, the bush, the cloud, and
the fire which came from heaven, speaking
and manifesting himself to his people by his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-208">[pg 1-208]</span><a name="Pg1-208" id="Pg1-208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
own immediate voice, and miraculous extraordinary
presence, so that worshipping before
these things had the same reason which
makes the twenty-four elders in heaven worship
before the throne, Rev. iv. 10; for in
these things God did immediately manifest
his presence as well as in heaven. Though
there be a difference in the degrees of the
immediate manifestation of his presence in
earth and in heaven, yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magis et minus
non variant speciem</span></span>. Now God is present
in the sacrament, not extraordinarily, but in
the way of an ordinary dispensation, not immediately,
but mediately. They must therefore
allege some commendable examples of
such a kneeling as we dispute about, in a
mediate and ordinary worship, else they say
nothing to the point.

fell on his face, and when the fire came
down at Elijah's prayer, the people fell on
their faces. What is this to the purpose?
And how shall kneeling in a mediate and
ordinary worship be warranted by kneeling
in the hearing of God's own immediate
voice, or in seeing the miraculous signs of
his extraordinary presence? Howbeit it
cannot be proved, neither, that the people
fell on their faces in the very act of seeing
the fire fall (when their eyes and their
minds were fastened upon it), but that after
they had seen the miracle wrought, they so
considered of it as to fall down and worship
God.

to the meat, which is purposely set on table,
&amp;c. The pastor, when he begins the holy
action, hath the bread and the cup set before
him purposely upon the table, and with
respect to them he gives thanks,”</span> &amp;c.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Though a penitentiary kneel to God
purposely in the presence and sight of the
congregation, that he may make known to
them his repentance for the sin whereby he
hath scandalised them, yet is the confessing
of his sin to God, kneeling there upon his
knees, an immediate worship, neither doth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-209">[pg 1-209]</span><a name="Pg1-209" id="Pg1-209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the congregation come betwixt him and
God, as belonging to the substance of this
worship, for he kneeleth to God as well, and
maketh confession of his sin, when the congregation
is not before him. But I suppose
our kneelers themselves will confess, that
the elements come so betwixt God and them
when they kneel, that they belong to the
essence of the worship in hand, and that
they would not, nor could not, worship the
flesh and blood of Christ in the sacrament,
if the elements were not before them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To be short, the case of a penitentiary
standeth thus, that not in his kneeling <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span></span>,
but in his kneeling publicly and in
sight of the congregation, he setteth them
before him purposely, and with a respect to
them, whereas our kneelers do kneel in
such sort that their kneeling <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span></span>,
and without an adjection or adjunct, hath a
respect to the elements purposely set before
them, neither would they at all kneel for
that end and purpose for which they do
kneel, namely, for worshipping the flesh
and blood of Christ in the sacrament,<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> except
the elements were before the eyes both
of their minds and bodies, as the penitentiary
doth kneel for making confession of
his sin to God, when the congregation is not
before him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And if one would say, that in kneeling at
the sacrament he worshippeth not the flesh
and blood of Christ, but the Lord his God
only, yet is the same difference to be put
betwixt his kneeling before the elements,
and the kneeling of a penitentiary before
the congregation, for the very kneeling itself
(simply considered) before the elements,
respecteth them as then purposely set in our
sight that we may kneel before them, whereas,
in the case of the penitentiary, it is not
his kneeling to confess his sin to God which
hath a respect to the congregation as set in
his sight for that purpose, but some circumstances
of his kneeling only, to wit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when</span></em>?
At that time when the congregation is assembled.
And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where</span></em>? Publicly in sight of
the congregation! In regard of these circumstances,
he hath the congregation purposely
in his sight, and so respecteth them,
but in regard of the kneeling itself simply,
the presence of the congregation is but accidental
to him who kneeleth and confesseth
his sin before God. As touching giving
thanks before the meat set on our common
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-210">[pg 1-210]</span><a name="Pg1-210" id="Pg1-210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tables, though a man should do it kneeling,
yet this speaketh not home to the point now
in controversy, except a man so kneel before
his meat, that he have a religious respect to
it as a thing separated from a common use
and made holy, and likewise have both his
mind, and his external senses of seeing,
touching, and tasting, fastened upon it in
the act of his kneeling. And if a man
should thus kneel before his meat, he were
an idolater.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, Giving thanks before the elements
of bread and wine, in the beginning of the
holy action, is as far from the purpose; for
this giving of thanks is an immediate worship
of God, wherein we have our minds
and senses, not upon the bread and wine as
upon things which have a state in that worship
of the Lord's supper, and belong to the
substance of the same (for the very consecration
of them to this use is but then <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in fieri</span></span>),
but we worship God immediately by prayer
and giving of thanks, which is all otherwise
in the act of receiving.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 19. Moreover it is
objected<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750" href="#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">750</span></span></a> out of
Lev. ix. 24; 2 Chron. vii. 3; Mich. vi. 6;
2 Chron. xxix. 28-30, that all the people
fell on their faces before the legal sacrifices,
when the fire consumed the burnt-offering.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whereunto it may be answered, that
the fire which came from God and consumed
the burnt-offerings, was one of the
miraculous signs of God's extraordinary and
immediate presence (as I have said before),
and therefore kneeling before the same hath
nothing to do with the present purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if we will particularly consider all
these places, we find in the first two, that
beside the fire, the glory of the Lord did
also appear in a more miraculous and extraordinary
manner, Lev. ix. 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“The glory
of the Lord appeared to all the people;”</span>
2 Chron. vii. 1, 12, <span class="tei tei-q">“The glory of the Lord
filled the house.”</span> They are therefore running
at random who take hold of those
places to draw out of them the lawfulness
of kneeling in a mediate and ordinary
worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The place of Micah I have answered before;
and here I add, that though it could
be proved from that place (as it cannot),
that the people have bowed before the offerings,
and that in the very act of offering,
yet how shall it be proved, that in the act
of their kneeling they had the offerings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-211">[pg 1-211]</span><a name="Pg1-211" id="Pg1-211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purposely before them, and their minds and
senses fixed upon them in the very instant
of their worshipping.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This I make clear by the last place,
2 Chron. xxix., out of which no more can
be drawn but that the people worshipped
whilst the priests were yet offering the
burnt-offering. Now the burnt-offering was
but accidentally before the people in their
worshipping, and only because it was offered
at the same time when the song of the Lord
was sung, ver. 27. Such was the forwardness
of zeal in restoring religion and purging
the temple, that it admitted no stay,
but eagerly prosecuted the work till it was
perfected; therefore the thing was done
suddenly, ver. 36. Since, then, the song
and the sacrifice were performed at the
same time, we must note that the people
worshipped at that time, not because of the
sacrifice, which was a mediate worship, but
because of the song of the Lord, which was
an immediate worship. Now we all commend
kneeling in an immediate worship.
But this cannot content our opposites; they
will needs have it lawful to kneel, in the
hearing of the word, purposely, and with a
respect to the word preached (though this
be a mediate worship only). Their
warrants<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href="#note_751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a>
are taken out, Exod. iv. 30, 31;
Exod. xii. 27; 2 Chron. xx. 18; Matt.
xvii. 6. From the first three places no
more can be inferred but that these hearers
bowed their heads and worshipped, after
that they heard the word of the Lord;
neither shall they ever warrant bowing and
worshipping in the act of hearing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the fourth place, we read that the disciples
fell on their faces when they heard
God's own immediate voice out of the cloud.
What maketh this for falling down to worship
at the hearing of the word preached by
men? How long shall our opposites not distinguish
betwixt mediate and immediate
worship?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, It is alleged<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href="#note_752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a> that God, in his
word, allows not only kneeling at prayer,
out also at circumcision, passover, and baptism.
The reason of this assertion is given
to be this, that a bodily gesture being necessary,
God not determining man upon any
one, leaves him at plain liberty. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>
Whether we be left at plain liberty in all
things which being in the general necessary,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-212">[pg 1-212]</span><a name="Pg1-212" id="Pg1-212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are not particularly determined in God's
word, it shall be treated of elsewhere in
this dispute. In the meantime, whatsoever
liberty God leaves man in bodily gestures,
he leaves him no liberty of an unlawful and
idolatrous gesture, such as kneeling in the
instant of receiving a sacrament, when not
only we have the outward sign purposely
before us, and our minds and senses fastened
upon it, for discerning the signification
thereof, and the analogy betwixt it and the
thing signified, but also to look upon it as
an image of Christ, or as a vicarious sign
standing there in Christ's stead. The indifferency
of such a gesture in such a mediate
worship should have been proved before
such a rule (as this here given us for a
reason) had been applied to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 20. But the kneelers would yet
make more ado to us, and be still stirring if
they can do no more. Wherefore one of our
doctors objecteth,<a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href="#note_753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a> that we lift up our eyes
and our hands to heaven, and worship God,
yet we do not worship the heaven; that a
man going to bed, prayeth before his bed;
that David offered the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
in the presence of all the people,
Psal. cxvi; that Paul, having taken bread,
gave thanks before all them who were in
the ship, Acts xxvii. 36; that the Israelites
worshipped before Moses and Aaron, Exod.
iv. 31. Hereupon another doctor, harping
upon the same string, tells us,<a id="noteref_754" name="noteref_754" href="#note_754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">754</span></span></a> that when
we kneel in the act of receiving the sacrament,
<span class="tei tei-q">“we kneel no more to bread than to
the pulpit when we join our prayers with
the minister's.”</span> Oh, unworthy instances,
and reproachful to doctors! All these things
were and are accidentally present to the
worshippers, and not purposely before them,
nor respected as having a religious state in
the worship. What? Do we worship before
the bread in the sacrament, even as before
a pulpit, a bed, &amp;c.? Nay, graduate men
should understand better what they speak
of.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another objection is,<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755" href="#note_755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a> that a man who is
admitted to the office of a pastor, and receiveth
imposition of hands, kneeleth still on his
knees till the ordination be ended, the rest
about him being standing or sitting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Kneeling in receiving imposition of
hands, which is joined with prayer and invocation,
hath nothing ado with kneeling in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-213">[pg 1-213]</span><a name="Pg1-213" id="Pg1-213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a mediate worship; for in this case a man
kneels because of the immediate worship of
invocation; but when there is no prayer, I
suppose no man will kneel religiously, and
with a religious respect to those persons or
things which are before him, as there purposely
in his sight, that before them he may
adore (which is the kind of kneeling now in
question), or if any did so, there were more
need to give him instruction than ordination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is further told us, that he who is baptized,<a id="noteref_756" name="noteref_756" href="#note_756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">756</span></span></a>
or he who offers him that is to be
baptized, humbleth himself, and prayeth
that the baptism may be saving unto life
eternal, yet worshippeth not the bason nor
the water. But how long shall simple ones
love simplicity, or rather, scorners hate
knowledge? Why is kneeling in the immediate
worship of prayer, wherein our
minds do purposely respect no earthly thing
(but the soul, Psal. xxv. 1, the heart, the
hands, Lam. iii. 41, the eyes, Psal. cxxiii.
1, the voice, Psal. v. 3, all directed immediately
to heaven) paralleled with kneeling
in the mediate worship of receiving the sacrament,
wherein we respect purposely the
outward sign, which is then in our sight,
that both our minds and our external senses
may be fastened upon it? Our minds, by
meditation, and attentive consideration of
that which is signified, and of the representation
thereof by the sign. Our senses, by
seeing, handling, breaking, tasting, eating,
drinking.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 21. Thus we see that in all these examples
alleged by our opposites, there is
nothing to prove the lawfulness of kneeling
in such a mediate worship, wherein
something belonging to the substance of the
worship comes between God and us, and is
not accidentally, but purposely before us,
upon which also our minds and senses in the
action of worship are fast fixed. Howbeit
there is another respect, wherefore none of
these examples can make ought for kneeling
in the act of receiving the sacrament (which
I have showed before), namely, that in the
instant of receiving the sacrament, the elements
are actually images and vicarious
signs standing in Christ's stead. But belike
our kneelers have not satisfied themselves
with the roving rabble of these impertinent
allegations which they have produced
to prove the lawfulness of kneeling in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-214">[pg 1-214]</span><a name="Pg1-214" id="Pg1-214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a mediate worship, they have prepared another
refuge for themselves, which had been
needless, if they had not feared that the
former ground should fail them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then will they say next to us?
Forsooth, that when they kneel in the act
of receiving, they are praying and praising,
and so worshipping God immediately. And
if we would know what a man doth then
pray for, it is told us, that he is praying and
earnestly crying to God,<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href="#note_757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut eum faciat
dignum convivam</span></span>. To us it seems very
strange how a man, when he is actually a
banqueter, and at the instant of his communicating
can be made in any other sort a
banqueter than he is; for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quicquid est,
dum est, non potest non esse</span></span>. Wherefore
if a man in the instant of his receiving be
an unworthy banqueter, he cannot at that
instant be made any other than he is.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 22. The truth is, we cannot lawfully
be either praying or praising in the
very act of receiving, because our hearts and
minds should then be exercised in meditating
upon Christ's death, and the inestimable
benefits which comes to us thereby. 1 Cor.
xi. 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do this in remembrance of me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This remembrance is described, ver. 26,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye do show the Lord's death.”</span> Now one
of the special ways whereby we remember
Christ, and so do show forth his death, is by
private meditation upon his death, as Pareus
resolveth.<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This meditation is a speech of the soul to
itself; and though it may stand with short
ejaculations, which may and should have
place in all our actions, yet can it not stand
with an ordinary and continued prayer purposely
conceived, as Bishop Lindsey would
maintain.<a id="noteref_759" name="noteref_759" href="#note_759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">759</span></span></a> For how can we orderly both
speak to God by prayer, and to ourselves by
meditation, at one instant of time? If therefore
prayer be purposely and orderly conceived,
it banisheth away meditation, which
should be the soul's exercise in the receiving
of the sacrament. And by the contrary, if
meditation be entertained as it should be, it
admitteth not prayer to have place at that
time. For it is well said,<a id="noteref_760" name="noteref_760" href="#note_760"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">760</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dum auribus,

proveth that we should be praying and
praising in the act of receiving the sacrament.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Whatsoever spiritual benefit (saith
he)<a id="noteref_761" name="noteref_761" href="#note_761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">761</span></span></a>
we should receive with a spiritual hunger
and thirst, and with a spiritual appetite
and desire after the grace and virtue that is
therein to salvation, the same we should
receive with prayer, which is nothing else
but such an appetite and desire; but the
body and blood of Christ is such a benefit,”</span>
&amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Why did not he prove his proposition?
Thought he his bare assertion
should suffice? God's word is a spiritual
benefit, which we should receive with spiritual
hunger and thirst; yet the Bishop will
not say that we should be praying all the
while we are hearing and receiving it, for
then could not our minds be attentive. His
proposition therefore is false; for though
prayer should go before the receiving of such
a spiritual benefit as the word or the sacrament,
yet we should not pray in the act of
receiving. For how can the heart attend,
by serious consideration, to what we hear in
the word, or what is signified and given to
us in the sacrament, if in the actions of hearing
the word and receiving the sacrament,
it should be elevated out of the world by
prayer?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Why saith he that prayer is nothing
else but a spiritual appetite or desire? He
thought hereby to strengthen his proposition,
but we deny all. He said before,<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762" href="#note_762"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">762</span></span></a> that
every prayer is a meditation, and here he
saith, that prayer is nothing else but a spiritual
desire. These are uncouth descriptions
of prayer. Prayer is not meditation, because
meditation is a communing with our own
souls, prayer a communing with God. Nor
yet can it be said that prayer is nothing
else but a spiritual desire; for prayer is the
sending up of our desires to God, being put
in order.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 24. He speeds no better in proving
that we should receive the sacrament with
thanksgiving. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatsoever benefit (saith

words of St. Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">“So oft as ye shall eat

Lord's death, must not be restricted to the
act of receiving the sacrament, because we do
also show forth his death by the preaching of
the gospel, and by private and public celebration
of it, yea, by a perpetual study of
sanctification and thankfulness. So that the
showing forth of the Lord's death, by extolling,
preaching, magnifying, and praising
the same, according to the twenty-third
section of the Confession of Faith, to which
his argument hath reference, may not be
expounded of the very act of receiving the
sacrament. Neither do the words of the
institution refuse, but easily admit, another
showing forth of the Lord's death than that
which is in the very act of receiving, for the
word is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quando</span></span>, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quoties</span></span>. It is only

adoring gesture.

He shoots short of his proofs, and hits
not the mark. One place in Tertullian, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
Oratione</span></span>, he hammers upon: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Similiter de
stationum diebus non putant plerique sacrificiorum

quod statio solvenda sit accepto corpore
Domini. Ergo devotum Deo obsequium

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these words the Doctor giveth this
sense: That many withdrew themselves
when they came to the celebration of the
supper, because the body of our Lord, that
is, the sacramental bread, being taken of
the minister's hand, the station, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, standing,
must be dissolved and left; and because
standing on those days might not be left (as
they thought), therefore they rather left the
sacrament on those days than they would
break the rule of standing on those days;
therefore they forbore:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Which can have no reason but this, that
taking the holy things at the table standing,
yet they used not to partake them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, eat
the bread or drink the wine, in any other
gesture than what was on the station days
then forbidden, kneeling; and that Tertullian
wishes them to come, though they might
not then kneel, and to take the bread in
public, standing at the table, and reserve
it, and carry it away with them, and receive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-218">[pg 1-218]</span><a name="Pg1-218" id="Pg1-218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

kneeling.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> The Doctor by this puts a weapon
in our hands against himself; for if, when
they had taken the bread of the minister's
hand, their standing was to be left and dissolved,
and Tertullian, by commending to
them another gesture in the eating of the
bread, not standing, then whether urgeth
he that other gesture to be used in the public
eating of the bread or the private? Not
in the private; for his advice of reserving
and eating it in private, cometh after, and is
only put for a remedy or next best, in case
they would not condescend to this course in
public, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod statio solvenda sit accepto
corpore domini</span></span>. Needs, then, it must be
understood of the public. Now, if in the
public eating of the bread standing was to
be left, which gesture was to come in place
of it? Not kneeling.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. Tertullian saith<a id="noteref_767" name="noteref_767" href="#note_767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a> elsewhere: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diebus

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The doctor himself saith, that upon
these station days kneeling was restrained,
not only in prayer, but in all divine service.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherefore, if, according to the Doctor's
gloss, the gesture of standing was left or
dissolved, that gesture which had come in
place of it to be used in the partaking of the
sacrament, can hardly be imagined to have
been any other nor sitting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well, the doctor hath unhappily raised
this spirit to disquiet himself: let him bethink
how to lay him again. If he cannot,
I will assay to make some help, and to lay
him in this fashion. The station days were
not the Lord's days, together with those
fifty betwixt Easter and Pentecost (on
which both fasting and kneeling were forbidden),
as the Doctor thinketh, but they
were certain set days of fasting; for they
appointed the fourth and sixth day of the
week (that is, Wednesday and Friday) for their
stations, as Tertullian saith;<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href="#note_768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a> whose
words we may understand by another place
of Epiphanus,<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href="#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a> who writeth that the fast
of the fourth and the sixth day was kept
throughout all churches, and held to be an
apostolical constitution. Howbeit herein
they did err; for to appoint a certain time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-219">[pg 1-219]</span><a name="Pg1-219" id="Pg1-219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of fasting to be kept by the whole church
agreeth not with Christian liberty, and wanteth
the example of Christ and his apostles,
as Osiander noteth.<a id="noteref_770" name="noteref_770" href="#note_770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">770</span></span></a> Always we see what
was meant by station days, to wit, their set
days of fifty, fasting, which were called station
days, by a speech borrowed from a military
custom, as Tertullian teacheth. For as
soldiers kept those times and places which
were appointed for their watches, and fasted
all the while they continued in them, so
did Christians upon their station days resort
and meet in the place appointed, and there
remained fasting till their station dissolved.
The Doctor taketh upon him to confute those
who understand by the station days set days
of fasting; but all which he allegeth to the
contrary is, that he findeth somewhere in Tertullian
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">statio</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jejunia</span></span> put for different
things. Now this helpeth him not, except
he could find that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">statio</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stata
jejunia</span></span> are put for different things; for no
man taketh the stations to have been occasional,
but only set fasts. Touching the
meaning, then, of the words alleged by the
Doctor (to give him his own reading of
them, howbeit some read otherwise), thus
we take it. There were many who came
not to the sacrament upon the station days,
because (in their opinion) the receiving
thereof should break the station, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the
service of the day, and that because it should
break their fast, a principal duty of the
same. Tertullian showeth they were in
error, because their partaking of the sacrament
should not break their station, but
make it the more solemn and remarkable.
But if they could not be drawn from that
false persuasion of theirs, that the sacrament
should break their fast, yet he wisheth
them at least to come and stand at the
table, and receive the sacrament into their
hands, and take it away to eat after (for
permitting whereof he had no warrant), so
should they both partake the sacrament and
also (according to their mind, and to their
full contentment) keep their stations, which
were often prorogated till even,<a id="noteref_771" name="noteref_771" href="#note_771"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">771</span></span></a> but ever
and at least till the ninth hour.<a id="noteref_772" name="noteref_772" href="#note_772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">772</span></span></a> Finally,
from this place, which the Doctor perverteth
for kneeling, it appeareth that the gesture
or posture in receiving the sacrament used
in that place where Tertullian lived, was
standing; because, speaking of the receiving
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-220">[pg 1-220]</span><a name="Pg1-220" id="Pg1-220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the sacrament, he saith, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Si et ad aram
Dei steteris</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 27. As for the rest of the testimonies
Dr Burges produceth out of the fathers
for kneeling,<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href="#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a> I need not insist upon them,
for either they speak of the inward adoration
of the heart, which we ought to direct
unto Christ when we receive the sacrament
(and this none of us denieth), or else they
speak of adoring the sacrament, where, by
the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">adoration</span></span>, we may not understand
any divine worship, inward or outward, but
a reverence of another nature called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">veneration</span></span>.
That this (which we deny not neither),
and no more, is meant by the fathers
when they speak of the adoration of
the sacrament, Antonius de Dominis showeth
more copiously.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href="#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a> And thus we have
suffered the impetuous current of the Doctor's
audacious promises, backed with a verbal
discourse to go softly by us. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid dignum
tanto tulit hic promissor hiatu?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 28. Finally, If any be curious to
know what gesture the ancient church did
use in the receiving of the eucharist, to
such I say, first of all, that Didoclavius
maintaineth that which none of our opposites
are able to infringe, namely, that no
testimony can be produced which may
evince that ever kneeling was used before
the time of Honorius III., neither is it less
truly observed by the author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History
of the Waldenses</span></span>,<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href="#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a> that bowing of the knees
before the host was then only enjoined when
the opinion of transubstantiation got place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next I say, the ancient gesture, whereof
we read most frequently, was standing.
Chrysostom, complaining of few communicants,
saith,<a id="noteref_776" name="noteref_776" href="#note_776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frustra habetur quotidiana

writers<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href="#note_777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a> make out of Dionysius Alexandrinus's
epistle to Xistus, bishop of Rome,
that the custom of the church of Alexandria
in receiving the sacrament, was, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut
mensae assisterent</span></span>. It is also noted by Hospiman,<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href="#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a>
that in the days of Tertullian the
Christians <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stantes sacramenta percipiebant</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, I say, since we all know that the
primitive Christians did take the holy communion
mixedly, and together with their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-221">[pg 1-221]</span><a name="Pg1-221" id="Pg1-221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
love-feasts, in imitation of Christ,<a id="noteref_779" name="noteref_779" href="#note_779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a> who,
whilst he did eat his other supper, did also
institute the eucharist; and since (as it is
observed from 1 Cor. xi. 21, 33<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a>) there was
a twofold abuse in the church of Corinth
<span class="tei tei-q">“one in their love-feasts, whilst that which
should have served for the knitting of the
knot of love was used to cut the cords
thereof, in that every one (as he best
liked) made choice of such as he would have
to sit at table with him (the other either
not tarried for, or shut out when they came,
especially the poor). The other abuse (pulled
in by the former) was, for that those which
were companions at one table in the common
feast communicated also in the sacred
with the same separation, and severally from
the rest of the church (and the poor especially)
which was in their former banquets.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since also we read that the same custom
of joining the Lord's supper together with
common feasts continued long after; for
Socrates reporteth,<a id="noteref_781" name="noteref_781" href="#note_781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a> that the Egyptians adjoining
unto Alexandria, together with the
inhabitants of Thebes, used to celebrate the
communion upon the Sunday,<a id="noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> after this
manner, <span class="tei tei-q">“when they have banqueted, filled
themselves with sundry delicate dishes, in
the evening, after service, they use to communicate.”</span>
How, then, can any man think
that the gesture then used in the Lord's
supper was any other, than the same which
was used in the love-feast or common supper?
And what was that but the ordinary
fashion of sitting at table? Since the Laodicean
canon,<a id="noteref_783" name="noteref_783" href="#note_783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a> which did discharge the love-feasts
about the year 368, importeth no less
than that the gesture used in them was sitting
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non oportet in Basilicis seu ecclesiis.
Agapen facere et intus manducare,
vel accubitus sternere.</span></span> Now, if not only
divines of our side, but Papists also, put it
out of doubt that Christ gave the eucharist
to his apostles sitting, because being set
down to the preceding supper, it is said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">while as they did eat, he took bread</span></em>,”</span>
&amp;c. (of which things I am to speak afterward),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-222">[pg 1-222]</span><a name="Pg1-222" id="Pg1-222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what doth hinder us to gather, in
like manner, that forasmuch as those primitive
Christians did take the Lord's supper
whilst they did eat their own love-feasts,
therefore they sat at the one as well as the
other? And so I close with this collection.
Whatsoever gesture in process of time crept
into the Lord's supper otherwise than sitting,
of it we may truly say, <span class="tei tei-q">“from the beginning
it was not so.”</span>

have kneeling at the Lord's supper to be a
signification of the humble and grateful acknowledging
of the benefits of Christ. The
prayer which the English service book appointeth
bishops to use after the confirming
of children by the imposition of hands,
avoucheth that ceremony of confirmation
for a sign whereby those children are certified
of God's favour and good-will towards
them. In the general, our opposites defend<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a>

that the church hath power to ordain such
ceremonies, as by admonishing men of their
duty, and by expressing such spiritual and
heavenly affections, dispositions, motions, or
desires, as should be in men, do thereby stir
them up to greater fervour and devotion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. But against the lawfulness of such
mystical and significant ceremonies, thus we
dispute: First, A chief part of the nature of
sacraments is given unto those ceremonies
when they are in this manner appointed to
teach by their signification. This reason being
alleged by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abridgement of the Lincoln
ministers</span></span>, Paybody answereth,<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href="#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> that
it is not a bare signification that makes a
thing participate of the sacrament's nature,
but such a signification as is sacramental,
both in what is signified and how. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
This is but to beg the question; for what
other thing is alleged by us, but that a sacramental
signification is placed in those
ceremonies we speak of? 2. What calls he
a sacramental signification, if a mystical resemblance
and representation of some spiritual
grace which God hath promised in his
word be not it? and that such a signification
as this is placed in the ceremonies, I
have already made it plain, from the testimonies
of our opposites. This, sure, makes
those ceremonies so to encroach upon the
confines and precincts of the nature and
quality of sacraments, that they usurp something
more than any rites which are not
appointed by God himself can rightly do.
And if they be not sacraments, yet, saith
Hooker,<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a> they are as sacraments. But in
Augustine's dialect, they are not only as
sacraments, but they themselves are sacraments.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Signa</span></span> (saith the father) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cum ad
res divinas pertinent, sacramenta appellantur</span></span>;
which testimony doth so master Dr
Burges, that he breaketh out into this witless
answer,<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href="#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">792</span></span></a> That the meaning of Augustine
was to show that the name of sacraments
belongeth properly to divine things, and not
to all signs of holy things. I take he would
have said, <span class="tei tei-q">“belongeth properly to the signs
of divine things.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And here, beside that which Ames
hath said against him, I add these two
things: 1. That this distinction cannot be
conceived which the Doctor maketh betwixt
the signs of divine things and the signs of
holy things. 2. That his other distinction
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-224">[pg 1-224]</span><a name="Pg1-224" id="Pg1-224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
can as little be conceived, which importeth
that the name of sacraments belongeth to
divine things properly, and to all signs of
holy things improperly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, If we call to mind that which
hath been evinced before, namely, that the
ceremonies are not only thought to be mystically
significant for setting forth and expressing
certain spiritual graces, but also
operative and available to the begetting of
those graces in us, if not by the work
wrought, at least by the work of the worker;
for example, that the sign of the cross is
not only thought by our opposites to signify
that at no time we should be ashamed of
the ignominy of Christ, but is also esteemed<a id="noteref_793" name="noteref_793" href="#note_793"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">793</span></span></a>
to be a means to work our preservation
from shame, and a most effectual teacher to
avoid that which may deservedly procure
shame; and that bishopping is not only
thought to be a sign for certifying young
children of God's favour and good-will towards
them, but also an exhibitive sign,<a id="noteref_794" name="noteref_794" href="#note_794"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a>
whereby they receive strength against sin

If these things, I say, we call to mind, it
will be more manifest that the ceremonies
are given out for sacred signs of the very
same nature that sacraments are of. For
the sacraments are called by divines commemorative,
representative and exhibitive
signs; and such signs are also the ceremonies
we have spoken of, in the opinion of
Formalists.

Lastly, We will consider the purpose of
Christ whilst he said to the Pharisees,<a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-226">[pg 1-226]</span><a name="Pg1-226" id="Pg1-226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
John: from that time the kingdom of God
is preached.”</span> He had in the parable of the
unjust steward, and in the application of
the same, spoken somewhat contemptibly of
riches, which, when the Pharisees heard, they
derided him, and that for this pretended reason
(as is evident from the answer which is
returned unto them), because the law promises
the world's goods as rewards and
blessings to the people of God, that by the
temporal things which are set forth for
types and shadows of eternal things, they
might be instructed, helped, and led, as it
were by the hand, to the contemplation,
desire and expectation, of those heavenly
and eternal things which are not seen.
Now Christ did not only rip up the hypocrisy
of their hearts, ver. 15, but also gave
a formal answer to their pretended reason,
by showing how the law is by him perfected,
ver. 16, yet not destroyed, ver. 17.
Then will we observe how he teacheth that
the law and the prophets are perfected, and
so our point shall be plain. <span class="tei tei-q">“The law and
the prophets were until John,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, they
did typify and prophesy concerning the
things of the kingdom until John; for
before that time the faithful only saw those
things afar off, and by types, shadows, and
figures, and the rudiments of the world,
were taught to know them. <span class="tei tei-q">“But from that
time the kingdom of God is preached,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the people of God are no longer to
be instructed concerning the things of the
kingdom of God by outward signs, or visible
shadows and figures, but only by the plain
word of the gospel; for now the kingdom of
God ἐυαγγελιζεται is not typified as before,
but plainly preached, as a thing exhibited
to us, and present with us. Thus we see
that to us, in the days of the gospel, the
word only is appointed to teach the things
belonging to the kingdom of God.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. If any man reply, that though
after the coming of Christ we are liberate
from the Jewish and typical significant ceremonies,
yet ought we to embrace those
ceremonies wherein the church of the New
Testament placeth some spiritual signification:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I answer, 1. That which hath been said
in this argument holdeth good against significant
ceremonies in general. Otherwise,
when we read of the abrogation of the ceremonial
law, we should only understand the
abrogation of those particular ordinances
which Moses delivered to the Jews concerning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-227">[pg 1-227]</span><a name="Pg1-227" id="Pg1-227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the ceremonies that were to endure
to the coming of Christ, and so, notwithstanding
all this, the church should still
have power to set up new ceremonial laws
instead of the old, even which and how
many she listeth.

2. What can be answered to that which

this matter? <span class="tei tei-q">“It is much less lawful (say
those ministers) for man to bring significant
ceremonies into God's worship now than it
was under the law. For God hath abrogated
his own (not only such as prefigured
Christ, but such also as served by their signification
to teach moral duties), so as now
(without great sin) none of them can be
continued in the church, no, not for signification.”</span>
Whereupon they infer: <span class="tei tei-q">“If those
ceremonies which God himself ordained to
teach his church by their signification may
not now be used, much less may those which
man hath devised.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. Fourthly, Sacred significant ceremonies
devised by man are to be reckoned
among those images forbidden in the
second commandment. Polanus saith,<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a> that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnis figura illicita</span></span> is forbidden in the
second commandment. The Professors<a id="noteref_804" name="noteref_804" href="#note_804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a>
of Leyden call it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">imaginem quamlibet,
sive mente conceptam, sive manu effictam</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have showed elsewhere,<a id="noteref_805" name="noteref_805" href="#note_805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a> that both in
the writings of the fathers, and of Formalists
themselves, sacraments get the name of
images; and why, then, are not all significant
and holy ceremonies to be accounted
images? Now, the second commandment
forbiddeth images made by the lust of man
(that I may use Dr Burges's phrase<a id="noteref_806" name="noteref_806" href="#note_806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">806</span></span></a>), therefore
it forbiddeth also all religious similitudes,
which are homogeneal unto them.
This is the inference of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abridgement</span></span>,
whereat Paybody starteth,<a id="noteref_807" name="noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a> and replieth,
that the gestures which the people of God
used in circumcision and baptism, the rending
of the garment used in humiliation and
prayer, Ezra ix. 5; 2 Kings xxii. 19, Jer.
xxxvi. 24, lifting up the hands, kneeling
with the knees, uncovering the head in the
sacrament, standing and sitting at the sacrament,
were, and are, significant in worshipping,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-228">[pg 1-228]</span><a name="Pg1-228" id="Pg1-228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet are not forbidden by the second
commandment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> There are three sorts of signs here
to be distinguished. 1. Natural signs: so
smoke is a sign of fire, and the dawning of
the day a sign of the rising of the sun. 2.
Customable signs; and so the uncovering of
the head, which of old was a sign of preeminence,
hath, through custom, become a
sign of subjection. 3. Voluntary signs,
which are called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">signa instituta</span></span>; these are
either sacred or civil. To appoint sacred
signs of heavenly mysteries or spiritual
graces is God's own peculiar, and of this
kind are the holy sacraments. Civil signs
for civil and moral uses may be, and are,
commendably appointed by men, both in
church and commonwealth; and thus the
tolling of a bell is a sign given for assembling,
and hath the same signification both
in ecclesiastical and secular assemblings.
Now, besides the sacred signs of God's own
institution, we know that natural signs have
also place in divine worship; thus kneeling
in time of prayer signifieth the submission
of our hearts and minds, the lifting up of
our eyes and hands signifieth the elevation
of our affections; the rending of the garments
signified the rending of the heart by
sorrow; standing with a religious suspect to
that which is before us signifieth veneration
or reverence; sitting at table signifieth familiarity
and fellowship. <span class="tei tei-q">“For which of
you (saith our Master), Luke xvii. 7, having
a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will
say unto him by and by, when he is come
from the field, Go and sit down to meat?”</span>
All these signs have their significations from
nature. And if it be said that howbeit
sitting at our common tables be a sign natural
to signify familiarity amongst us, yet nature
hath not given such a signification to
sitting at the Lord's table,—I answer, that
sitting is a natural sign of familiarity, at
what table soever it be used. At the heavenly
table in the kingdom of glory, familiarity
is expressed and signified by sitting:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Many shall come from the east and
west, and shall sit down with Abraham,”</span>
&amp;c., Matt. xviii. 11. Much more, then, at
the spiritual table in the kingdom of grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The difference betwixt other common
tables and the Lord's table can infer no
more, but that with great humility we
ought to address ourselves unto it; yet still
we are to make use of our familiarity with
Christ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut tanquam in eodem toro accumbentes</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-229">[pg 1-229]</span><a name="Pg1-229" id="Pg1-229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as saith Chrysostom.<a id="noteref_808" name="noteref_808" href="#note_808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">808</span></span></a> Wherefore
we do not there so look to Christ in his
princely throne and glorious majesty, exalted
far above all principalities and powers,
as to forget that he is our loving and kind
banqueter, who hath admitted us to that familiar
fellowship with him which is signified
by our sitting at his table.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, Customable signs have likewise
place in divine service; for so a man coming
into one of our churches in time of public
worship, if he see the hearers covered,
he knows by this customable sign that sermon
is begun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, Civil or moral signs instituted
by men for that common order and decency
which is respect both in civil and sacred actions,
have also place in the acts of God's
worship. Thus a bason and a laver set before
a pulpit are signs of baptism to be
ministered; but common decency teacheth
us to make the same use of a bason and a
laver in civility which a minister maketh of
them in the action of baptising. All our
question is about sacred mystical signs.
Every sign of this kind which is not ordained
of God we refer to the imagery forbidden
in the second commandment; so
that in the tossing of this argument Paybody
is twice naught, neither hath he said
aught for evincing the lawfulness of sacred
significant ceremonies ordained of men,
which we impugn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. Fifthly, The significancy and
teaching office of mystical ceremonies invented
by men, must be drawn under those
doctrines of men condemned in the gospel.
Wherefore was it that the divers washings
of the Pharisees were rejected by Christ as
a vain worship? Was it not because they
were appointed for doctrines? <span class="tei tei-q">“In vain
(saith he) do they worship me, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men,”</span> Mark
vii. 7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The divers washings commanded in the
law were fore-signifying to the people, and
for teaching them what true and inward
holiness God required of them. Now, the
Pharisees, when they multiplied their washings
of hands, of cups and pots, brazen vessels
and tables, had the same respect of significancy
before their eyes. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Neque enim
alio spectabant</span></span> (that I may use the words
of a Formalist<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809" href="#note_809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quam ut se sanctitatis
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-230">[pg 1-230]</span><a name="Pg1-230" id="Pg1-230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
studiosos hoc externu ritu probarent</span></span>. Neither
have we any warrant to think that
they had another respect than this. But
the error was in their addition to the law,
and in that they made their own ceremonial
washings, which were only the commandments
of men, to serve for doctrines,
instructions and significations. For those
washings, as they were significant, and
taught what holiness or cleanness should be
among the people of God, they are called
by the name of worship; and as they were
such significant ceremonies as were only
commanded by men, they are reckoned for
vain worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And further, I demand why are the Colossians,
Col. ii. 20-22, rebuked for subjecting
themselves to those ordinances,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Touch
not, taste not, handle not?”</span> We
see that those ordinances were not bare
commandments, but commandments under
the colour of doctrines, to wit, as law commanded
a difference of meats, for signifying
that holiness which God would have his
people formed unto; so these false teachers
would have the same to be signified and
taught by that difference of meats and
abstinence which they of themselves, and
without the commandment of God, had ordained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, if we consider how that the
word of God is given unto us <span class="tei tei-q">“for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness, that the man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
works,”</span> 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17, it cannot but
be evident how superfluously, how superstitiously,
the office of sacred teaching and
mystical signification is given to dumb and
lifeless ceremonies ordained of men, and,
consequently, how justly they are taxed as
vain worship. We hold, therefore, with the
worthiest of our divines,<a id="noteref_810" name="noteref_810" href="#note_810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nullam doctrinam,
nullum sacram signum debere inter
pios admitti, nisi a Deo profecta esse
constet</span></span>.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 8. To these reasons which I have
put in order against men's significant ceremonies,
I will add a pretty history before I
go further.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the Superior of the Abbey of St.
Andrews<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811" href="#note_811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a> was disputing with John Knox
about the lawfulness of the ceremonies devised
by the church, to decore the sacraments
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-231">[pg 1-231]</span><a name="Pg1-231" id="Pg1-231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and other service of God, Knox answered:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The church ought to do nothing
but in faith, and ought not to go before, but
is bound to follow the voice of the true Pastor.”</span>
The Superior replied, that <span class="tei tei-q">“every
one of the ceremonies hath a godly signification,
and therefore they both proceed
from faith, and are done in faith.”</span> Knox
replieth: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not enough that man invent
a ceremony, and then give it a signification
according to his pleasure; for so
might the ceremonies of the Gentiles, and
this day the ceremonies of Mahomet be
maintained. But if that anything proceed
from faith it must have the word of God
for the assurance,”</span> &amp;c. The Superior answereth:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will ye bind us so strait that
we may do nothing without the express
word of God? What, and I ask drink?
think ye that I sin? and yet I have not
God's word for me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Knox here telleth him, first, that if he
should either eat or drink without the assurance
of God's word, he sinned; <span class="tei tei-q">“for saith
not the Apostle, speaking even of meat and
drink, that the creatures are sanctified unto
men by the word and prayer? The word is
this: all things are clean to the clean:
Now let me hear thus much of your ceremonies,
and I shall give you the argument?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But secondly, He tells him that he compared
indiscreetly together profane things
with holy; and that the question was not of
meat and drink, wherein the kingdom of
God consisteth not, but of matters of religion,
and that we may not take the same
freedom in the using of Christ's sacraments
that we may do in eating and drinking, because
Moses commanded, <span class="tei tei-q">“All that the
Lord thy God commanded thee to do, that
do thou to the Lord thy God; add nothing
to it, diminish nothing from it.”</span> The Superior
now saith that he was dry, and
thereupon desireth the grey friar Arbugkill
to follow the argument; but he was so
pressed with the same that he was confounded
in himself, and the Superior ashamed
of him:—

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 9. As for the examples alleged by
our opposites out of Scripture for justifying
their significant ceremonies, they have been
our propugners of evangelical simplicity
so often and so fully answered, that here I
need do no more but point at them. Of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-232">[pg 1-232]</span><a name="Pg1-232" id="Pg1-232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the days of Purim and feast of dedication I
am to speak afterward. In the meanwhile,
our opposites cannot, by these examples,
strengthen themselves in this present argument,
except they could prove that the feast
of dedication was lawfully instituted, and
that the days of Purim were appointed for
a religious festivity, and that upon no such
extraordinary warrant as the church hath
not ever and always. The rite which
Abraham commanded his servant to use
when he sware to him, namely, the putting
of his hand under his thigh, Gen. xxiv. 2,
maketh them as little help; for it was but a
moral sign of that civil subjection, reverence
and fidelity which inferiors owe unto
superiors, according to the judgment of
Calvin, Junius, Pareus, and Tremellius, all
upon that place. That altar which was
built by the Reubenites, Gadites, and half
tribe of Manasseh, Josh. xxii., had (as some
think) not a religious, but a moral use, and
was not a sacred, but a civil sign, to witness
that those two tribes and the half were of
the stock and lineage of Israel; which, if it
were once called in question, then their fear
(deducing the connection of causes and consequents)
led them in the end to forecast
this issue: <span class="tei tei-q">“In time to come your children
might speak unto our children, saying, What
have you to do with the Lord God of Israel?
for the Lord hath made Jordan a border betwixt
us and you,”</span> &amp;c. Therefore, to prevent
all apparent occasions of such doleful

Lord's altar, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut vinculum sit fraternæ

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And besides all this, there is nothing
which can urge us to say that the two tribes
and the half did commendably in the erecting
of this altar.<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href="#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> Calvin finds two faults
in their proceeding. 1. In that they attempted
such a notable and important innovation
without advising with their brethren
of the other tribes, and especially without
inquiring the will of God by the high priest.
2. Whereas the law of God commanded
only to make one altar, forasmuch as God
would be worshipped only in one place, they
did inordinately, scandalously, and with appearance
of evil, erect another altar; for
every one who should look upon it could
not but presently think that they had forsaken
the law, and were setting up a strange
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-233">[pg 1-233]</span><a name="Pg1-233" id="Pg1-233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and degenerate rite. Whether also that
altar which they set up for a pattern of the
Lord's altar, was one of the images forbidden
in the second commandment, I leave it
to the judicious reader to ruminate upon.
But if one would gather from ver. 33, that
the priest, and the princes, and the children
of Israel, did allow of that which the two
tribes and the half had done, because it is
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The thing pleased the children of
Israel, and the children of Israel blessed
God, and did not intend to go up against
them in battle:”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I answer, the Hebrew text hath it thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“And the word was good in the eyes of
the children of Israel,”</span> &amp;c.; that is, the
children of Israel blessed God for the word
which Phinehas and the ten princes brought
to them, because thereby they understood
that the two tribes and the half had not
turned away from following the Lord, nor
made them an altar for burnt-offerings or
sacrifice; which was enough to make them
(the nine tribes and a half) desist from their
purpose of going up to war against their
brethren, to shed their blood. Again, when
Phinehas and the ten princes say to the
Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of
Manasseh, This day we perceive that the
Lord is among us, <span class="tei tei-q">“because ye have not
committed this trespass against the Lord,”</span>
they do not exempt them from all prevarication;
only they say <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">signanter</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“this
trespass,”</span> to wit, of turning away from the
Lord, and building an altar for sacrifice,
whereof they were accused. Thus we see
that no approbation of that which the two
tribes and the half did, in erecting the altar,
can be drawn from the text.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 10. But to proceed, our opposites
allege for another example against us, a
new altar built by Solomon, 1 Kings viii.
64. In which place there is no such thing
to be found as a new altar built by Solomon;
but only that he sanctified the pavement
of the inner court, that the whole
court might be as an altar, necessity so requiring,
because the brazen altar of the
Lord was not able to contain so many sacrifices
as then were offered. The building of
synagogues can make as little against us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. After the tribes were settled in
the land of promise, synagogues were built,
in the case of an urgent necessity, because
all Israel could not come every Sabbath day
to the reading and expounding of the law in
the place which God had chosen that his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-234">[pg 1-234]</span><a name="Pg1-234" id="Pg1-234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
name might dwell there. What hath that
case to do with the addition of our unnecessary
ceremonies?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. If Formalists will make any advantage
of the building of synagogues, they must
prove that they were founded, not upon the
extraordinary warrant of prophets, but upon
that ordinary power which the church
retaineth still. As for the love-feasts used
in the primitive church, 1. They had no
religious state in divine worship, but were
used only as moral signs of mutual charity.
The Rhemists<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href="#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a> will have them to be called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">caenas dominicas</span></span>. But what saith Cartwright
against them? <span class="tei tei-q">“We grant that there
were such feasts used in times past, but
they were called by the name of ἀγάπαι
or love-feasts, not by the name of the Lord's
supper; neither could one without sacrilege
give so holy a name to a common feast,
which never had ground out of the word,
and which after, for just cause, was thrust
out by the word of God.”</span> 2. If it be
thought that they were used as sacred signs
of Christian charity because they were eaten
in the church, I answer, the eating of them
in the church is forbidden by the Apostle.
<span class="tei tei-q">“What! (saith he) have ye not houses to
eat and to drink in? or despise ye the
church of God?”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aperte vetat</span></span>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aliquae ecclesiae obtemperasse videntur.
Nam Justini temporibus Romana ecclesia

of charity used in those times, 2 Cor. xiii.
22, we say in like manner that it was but a
moral sign of that reconciliation, friendship
and amity, which showed itself as well at
holy assemblies as other meetings in that
kind and courtesy, but with all chaste salutation,
which was then in use.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 11. As for the veils wherewith the
Apostle would have women covered whilst
they were praying (that is, in their hearts
following the public and common prayer),
or prophesying (that is, singing, 1 Sam. x.
10; 1 Chron. xxv. 1), they are worthy to
be covered with shame as with a garment
who allege this example for sacred significant
ceremonies of human institution. This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-235">[pg 1-235]</span><a name="Pg1-235" id="Pg1-235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
covering was a moral sign for that comely
and orderly distinction of men and women
which civil decency required in all their
meetings; wherefore that distinction of habits
which they used for decency and comeliness
in their common behaviour and conversation,
the Apostle will have them, for
the same decency and comeliness, still to
retain in their holy assemblies. And further,
the Apostle showeth that it is also a
natural sign, and that nature itself teacheth
it; therefore he urgeth it both by the inferiority
or subjection of the woman, ver. 3,
8, 9 (for covering was then a sign of subjection),
and by the long hair which nature
gives to a woman, ver. 25; where he would
have the artificial covering to be fashioned
in imitation of the natural. What need we
any more? Let us see nature's institution,
or the Apostle's recommendation, for the
controverted ceremonies (as we have seen
them for women's veils), and we yield the
argument.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Last of all, the sign of imposition of
hands helpeth not the cause of our opposites,
because it has the example of Christ
and the apostles, and their disciples, which
our ceremonies have not; yet we think not
imposition of hands to be any sacred or
mystical sign, but only a moral, for designation
of a person: let them who think more
highly or honourably of it look to their
warrants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus have I thought it enough to take a
passing view of these objected instances,
without marking narrowly all the impertinencies
and falsehoods which here we find
in the reasoning of our opposites. One word
more, and so an end. Dr Burges would
comprehend the significancy of sacred ecclesiastical
ceremonies, for stirring men up
to the remembrance of some mystery of
piety or duty to God, under that edification
which is required in things that concern
order and decency by all divines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alas! what a sorry conceit is this? Divines,
indeed, do rightly require that those
alterable circumstances of divine worship
which are left to the determination of the
church be so ordered and disposed as they
may be profitable to this edification. But
this edification they speak of is no other
than that which is common to all our actions
and speeches. Are we not required to
do all things unto edifying, yea, to speak as
that our speech may be profitable unto edifying?
Now, such significations as we have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-236">[pg 1-236]</span><a name="Pg1-236" id="Pg1-236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
showed to be given to the ceremonies in
question, as, namely, to certify a child of
God's favour and goodwill towards him,—to
betoken that at no time Christians should
be ashamed of the ignominy of Christ,—to
signify the pureness that ought to be in the
minister of God,—to express the humble
and grateful acknowledgments of the benefits
of Christ, &amp;c.,—belong not to that edification
which divines require in things prescribed
by the church concerning order and
decency, except of every private and ordinary
action, in the whole course of our conversation,
we either deny that it should be
done unto edifying, or else affirm that it is
a sacred significant ceremony.

the warrants which our opposites pretend
for the lawfulness of the ceremonies. But
I perceive they know not well what ground
to take hold on. For instance whereof,
Hooker defendeth the lawfulness of festival
days by the law of nature.<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a> Dr Downame

sabbaths of rest appointed by the church,
such as the feasts of Christ's nativity, passion,
&amp;c., to be a duty commanded in the
law of God, and the not observing of them
to be a thing forbidden by the same law.
But Bishop Lindsey proveth the lawfulness
of those holidays<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a> from the power of the
church to make laws in such matters. <span class="tei tei-q">“As
for the Lord's day (saith he) which has succeeded
to the Jewish Sabbath, albeit God
hath commanded to sanctify it, yet neither
is the whole public worship, nor any part of
it appropriated to that time; but lawfully
the same may be performed upon any other
convenient day of the week, of the month,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-237">[pg 1-237]</span><a name="Pg1-237" id="Pg1-237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or of the year, as the church shall think
expedient. Upon this ground Zanchius
affirmed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiæ Christi liberum esse quos

deligere</span></span>. And by this warrant
did the primitive church sanctify those five
anniversary days of Christ's nativity,”</span> &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nay, let us observe how one of them
wavereth from himself in seeking here some
ground to rest upon. Paybody groundeth
the lawfulness of kneeling at the sacrament
on nature, part 2, cap. 4, sect. 1, on the
act of Parliament, part 3, cap. 1, sect. 31;
on an ecclesiastical canon, part 3, cap. 1,
sect. 33, on the king's sovereign authority,
part 3, cap. 1, sect. 36. Yet again he
saith, that this kneeling is grounded upon
the commandment of God, part 3, cap. 3,
sect. 11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well, I see our opposites sometimes warrant
the lawfulness of the ceremonies from
the law of God, sometimes from the law of
man, and sometimes from the law of nature,
but I will prove that the lawfulness of
those ceremonies we speak of can neither be
grounded upon the law of God, nor the law
of man, nor the law of nature, and by consequence
that they are not lawful at all, so
that, besides the answering of what our opposites
allege for the lawfulness of them, we
shall have a new argument to prove them
unlawful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. I begin with the law of God.
And, first, let us see what is alleged from
Scripture for the ceremonies in general;
then, after, let us look over particulars.
There is one place which they will have in
mythology to stand for the head of Medusa,
and if they still object to us for all their
ceremonies even that of the Apostle, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
all things be done decently and in order,”</span>
1 Cor. xiv. 40. What they have drawn out
of this place, Dr Burges<a id="noteref_819" name="noteref_819" href="#note_819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">819</span></span></a> hath refined in this
manner. He distinguished betwixt <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">præceptum</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">probatum</span></span>, and will have the
controverted ceremonies to be allowed of
God, though not commanded. And if we
would learn how these ceremonies are allowed
of God, he gives us to understand,<a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href="#note_820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a>
that it is by commanding the general kind
to which these particulars do belong. If we
ask what is this general kind commanded of
God, to which these ceremonies do belong?
he resolves us,<a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href="#note_821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a>
that it is order and decency:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-238">[pg 1-238]</span><a name="Pg1-238" id="Pg1-238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And if further we demand, how such ceremonies
as are instituted and used to stir up
men, in respect of their signification, unto
the devout remembrance of their duties to
God, are in such an institution and use,
matters of mere order? as a magisterial
dictator of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quodlibets</span></span>, he tells
us<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href="#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> that
they are matters of mere order, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sensu
largo</span></span>, in a large sense. But lastly, if we
doubt where he readeth of any worship
commanded in the general, and not commanded,
but only allowed in the particular,
he informeth us,<a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href="#note_823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a> that in the free-will offerings,
when a man was left at liberty to
offer a bullock, goat, or sheep at his pleasure,
if he chose a bullock to offer, that sacrifice,
in that particular, was not commanded,
but only allowed. What should I do,
but be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">surdus contra absurdum</span></span>? Nevertheless,
least this jolly fellow think himself
more jolly than he this, I answer, 1st,
How absurd a tenet is this, which holdeth
that there is some particular worship of
God allowed, and not commanded? What
new light is this which maketh all our divines
to have been in the mist, who have
acknowledged no worship of God, but that
which God hath commanded? Who ever
heard of commanded and allowed worship?
As for the instances of the free-will offerings,
Ames hath answered sufficiently,<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“that though the particulars were not, nor
could not be, determined by a distinct rule
in general, yet they were determined by
the circumstances, as our divines are wont
to answer the Papists about their vows,
councils, supererogations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not by a general
law, but by concurrence of circumstances.</span></em>
So Deut. xvi. 10, Moses showeth that the
freest offerings were to be according as God
had blessed them, from whence it followeth,
it had been sin for any Israelite whom God
had plentifully blessed, to offer a pair of
pigeons, instead of a bullock or two, upon
his own mere pleasure. Where that proportion
was observed, the choice of a goat
before a sheep, or a sheep before a goat,
was no formal worship.”</span>

appear that the English ceremonies do belong
to that order and decency which is
commanded? Bellarmine<a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href="#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a> would have all

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-239">[pg 1-239]</span><a name="Pg1-239" id="Pg1-239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
comprehended under order and decency,
and therefore warranteth them by that precept
of the Apostle, <span class="tei tei-q">“let all things be done
decently and in order.”</span> The one shall as
soon prove his point as the other, and that
shall be never.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. The Apostle only commanded
that each action and ceremony of God's
worship be decently and orderly performed,
but gives us no leave to excogitate or devise
new ceremonies, which have not been
instituted before. He hath spoken in that
chapter of assembling in the church, prophesying
and preaching, praying and praising
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now let all these things, and every other
action of God's worship, ceremonies and all,
be done decently and in order. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Licit ergo
Paulus</span></span>, &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“Albeit, therefore (saith John
Bastwick),<a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> Paul hath committed to the
church the judging both of decency and
order, yet hath he not granted any liberty
of such mystical ceremonies as by their
more inward signification do teach the duty
of piety; for since the whole liberty of the
church, in the matter of divine worship, is
exercised only in order and decency, it
followeth that they do impudently scorn
both God and the Scriptures, who do extend
this liberty to greater things, and
such as are placed above us. Most certain
it is, that Christ, the doctor of the church,
hath, by his own written and sealed word,
abundantly expounded unto us the will of
God. Neither is there further need of any
ceremonies, which by a secret virtue may
instruct us: neither is it less evident that
order consisteth not in the institution or use
of new things, but only in the right placing
of things which have been instituted before.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Decency (saith Balduine)<a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a> is opposed to
levity, and order to confusion.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectat autem
hic ordo potissimum ad ritus ecclesiae
in officiis sacris in quibus nullum debet
esse scandalum, nulla confusio.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then, in his judgment, order is not to
the rites of the church a general kind, but
only a concomitant circumstance; neither
are the rites of the church comprehended
under order as particulars under the general
kind to which they belong; but order belongeth
to the rites of the church as an
adjunct to the subject. And, I pray, must
not the rights of the church be managed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-240">[pg 1-240]</span><a name="Pg1-240" id="Pg1-240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with decency and order? If so, then must
our opposites either say that order is managed
with order, which is to speak nonsense,
or else, that the rights of the church
are not comprehended under order. But if
not, then it followeth that the rites of the
church are to be managed with levity, confusion,
and scandal; for every action that is
not done in decency and in order must
needs be done scandalously and confusedly.
2. Order and decency, whether taken <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">largo</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stricto sensu</span></span>, always signify such a
thing as ought to be in all human actions,
as well civil as sacred; for will any man
say, that the civil actions of men are not to
be done decently and in order? The directions
of order and decency<a id="noteref_828" name="noteref_828" href="#note_828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a> are not (we
see) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propria religionis</span></span>, but as Balduine
showeth<a id="noteref_829" name="noteref_829" href="#note_829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a> out of Gregory Nazianzen, order
is in all other things as well as in the
church. Wherefore sacred significant ceremonies
shall never be warranted by the
precept of order and decency, which have
no less in civility than in religion.

And as touching this blessing of children
and imposition of hands upon them
(saith Cartwright),<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> it is peculiar unto our
Saviour Christ, used neither by his disciples
nor his apostles, either before or after his
ascension, whereunto maketh that the children
being brought, that he should pray
over them, he did not pray for them, but
blessed them, that is to say, commended
them to be blessed, thereby to show his divine
power. These being also yet infants,
and in their swaddling clouts, as by the
word which the evangelist useth, and as by
our Saviour Christ's taking them into his
arms, doth appear, being also, in all likelihood,
unbaptised. Last of all, their confirmation
is a notable derogation unto the holy sacrament
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-241">[pg 1-241]</span><a name="Pg1-241" id="Pg1-241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of baptism, not alone in that it presumeth
the sealing of that which was sealed
sufficiently by it; but also in that, both by
asseveration of words, and by speciality of
the minister that giveth it, it is even preferred
unto it.

would draw some commendation to this
ceremony from those words of the psalm,
<span class="tei tei-q">“O come let us worship and bow down, let
us kneel before the Lord our Maker,”</span> Psal.
xcv. 6. Which is as if one should argue thus:
We may worship before the Lord, therefore
before a creature; we may kneel in an
immediate worship of God, therefore in a
mediate; for who seeth not that the kneeling
there spoken of is a kneeling in the action
of solemn praise and joyful noise of
singing unto the Lord? I wish you, my
masters, more sober spirits, that ye may fear
to take God's name in vain, even his word
which he hath magnified above all his name.
Dr Forbesse goeth about to warrant private
baptism,<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832" href="#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> by Philip's baptising the eunuch,
there being no greater company present, so
far as we can gather from the narration of
Luke, Acts viii.; as likewise by Paul and
Silas's baptising the jailer and all his in his
own private house, Acts xvi. Touching the
first of those places, we answer, 1. How
thinks he that a man of so great authority
and charge was alone in his journey? We
suppose a great man travelling in a chariot
must have some number of attendants,
especially having come to a solemn worship
at Jerusalem. 2. What Philip then did,
the extraordinary direction of the Spirit
guided him unto it, ver. 29, 39. As to the
other place, there was, in that time of persecution,
no liberty for Christians to meet
together in temples and public places, as
now there is. Wherefore the example of
Paul and Silas doth prove the lawfulness of
the like deed in the like case.

matter as a commendation of the sign of
the cross from these two places, Ezek. ix.
4; Rev. vii. 3; alleging, that because in the
forehead nothing is more plain to be seen
than the fear of contumely and disgrace,
therefore the Scripture describeth them
marked of God in the forehead, whom his
mercy hath undertaken to keep from final
confusion and shame.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a> Bellarmine allegeth

answer to the first, we say, that neither the
sign whereof we read in that place, nor yet
the use of it can make aught for them. As
for the sign itself; albeit the ancients did
interpret the sign of the letter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tau</span></span>, to have
been the sign of the cross, yet saith Junius,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bona illorum venia; Tquidem Graecorum,
Latinorumque majusculum, crucis quodam
modo signum videtur effingere, verum
hoc ad literam Haebreorum</span></span> Tau <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non potest
pertinere. Deinde ne ipsum quidem Grcaecorum
Latinorumque T, formam crucis
quae apud veteres in usu erat quum sumebantur

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whereupon dissenting from the ancients,
he delivers his own judgment, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tau</span></span> in
this place is taken <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">technicos</span></span>, for that sign or
mark of the letter wherewith the Lord commanded
to mark the elect for their safety
and preservation. And so there was no
mystery to be sought in that letter more
than in any other. As for the use of that
mark wherewith the elect in Jerusalem were
at that time sealed, it was only for distinction
and separation. It had the same use
which that sprinkling of the posts of the doors
had, Exod. xii. 7, only the foreheads of men
and women, and not the posts of doors were
here marked, because only the remnant according
to election, and not whole families
promiscuously, were at this time to be spared,
as Junius noteth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the use of the sign of the cross pretended
by Formalists, is not to separate us
in the time of judgment, but to teach that
at no time we ought to be ashamed of the
ignominy of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shortly, the sign wherewith they in Jerusalem
were marked, was for preservation
from judgment; but the sign of the cross is
used for preservation from sin. Thus we see,
that neither the sign nor the use of it, had
any affinity with the cross. Now, the surest
interpretation of that place, Ezek. ix. 4, is
to take <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tau</span></span> for an appellative noun, signifying
generally and indefinitely a mark or
sign, so that there is no mark determined
by this word; only there was a commandment
given to set a certain mark, some sign
or other, upon the foreheads of the elect.
So have our English translators taken the
place.

I answer, that Socrates, in that chapter,

those feasts were appointed to be kept with
the consent of the whole congregation of

from Esth. ix. 32, and 1 Maccab. iv. 59.

received. For they are not called the holidays
of Purim, but simply the days of Purim,—<span class="tei tei-q">“A

First, saith he, it is plain by verse 31,
they took it in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animas</span></span>, upon their souls,—a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soul matter</span></span> they made of it: there needs no
soul for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">feria</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">festum</span></span>, play or feasting.
They bound themselves <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">super animas suas</span></span>,

as well as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">anima</span></span>, and that the Hebrews do
not always put this word for our souls, but
very often for ourselves. So Psal. vii. 2.

our soul</span></span> for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></span>; and Gen. xlvi.
26, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">col-nephesch</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnis animae</span></span>,
for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnes
homines</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What have we any further need of testimonies?
Six hundred such are in the holy
text. And in this place, Esth. ix. 31,
what can be more plain, than that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nighal-naphscham,
upon their soul</span></span>, is put for
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nghalehem, upon themselves</span></span>, especially since
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nghalehem</span></span> is found to the same purpose,
both in ver. 27 and 31.

If we will make the text agree well with
itself, how can we but take both these for
one? But proceed we with the Bishop.
Secondly, saith he, the bond of it reacheth
to all that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">religioni eorum voluerunt copulari</span></span>,
ver. 27, then, a matter of religion it
was, had reference to that: what need any
joining in religion for a matter of good fellowship?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> There is no word in the text of religion.
Our English translation reads it,
<span class="tei tei-q">“all such as joined themselves unto them.”</span>
Montanus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnes adjunctos</span></span>; Tremellius,

Bishop doth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But no such thing can be drawn out of
the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hannilvim</span></span>, which is taken from
the radix <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lava</span></span>, signifying simply, and without
any adjection, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">adhaesit</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">adjunxit se</span></span>.
But let it be so, that the text meaneth
only such as were to adjoin themselves to
the religion of the Jews, yet why might
not the Jews have taken upon them a matter
of civility, not only for themselves, but
for such also as were to be joined with
them in religion. Could there be nothing
promised for proselytes, but only a matter
of religion?

what if we grant that this feast was a rite?
might it not, for all that, be merely civil?

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> The version which the Bishop followed,

of rites, it is certain that they belong to the

Fourthly, saith the Bishop, they fast and
pray here in this verse (meaning the 31st),

Bishop followeth, and whereupon he buildeth
this reason, readeth the 31st verse very
corruptly, and no ways according to the original,
as will easily appear to any who can
compare them together. Wherefore the
best interpreters take the fasting and prayer
spoken of verse 31, to be meant of the time
before their delivery. Now, after they
were delivered, they decreed that the matters
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-247">[pg 1-247]</span><a name="Pg1-247" id="Pg1-247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

were to solemnise that preservation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quam

I have answered already, that their fasting
and praying are not to be referred to
the days of Purim, which were memorials of
their delivery, but to the time past, when,
by the means of fasting and prayer, they did
impetrate their delivery, before ever the
days of Purim were heard of, and as touching
alms, it can make no holiday, because
much alms may be, and hath been given
upon days of civil joy and solemnity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the Bishop help not himself with his
sixth reason, he is like to come off with no
great credit. May we then know what
that is?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, saith he, as a holiday the Jews
ever kept it,—have a peculiar set service for
it in their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seders</span></span>, set psalms to sing, set
lessons to read, set prayers to say, good
and godly all,—none but as they have used
from all antiquity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. The Bishop could not have made
this word good, that the Jews did ever and
from all antiquity keep the days of Purim
in this fashion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. This manner of holding that feast,
whensoever it began, had no warrant from
the first institution, but was (as many other
things) taken up by the Jews in after ages,
and so the Bishop proveth not the point
which he taketh in hand, namely, that the
days spoken of in this text were enacted or
appointed to be kept as holidays.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The service which the Jews in latter
times use upon the days of Purim is not
much to be regarded. For as Godwin noteth
out of Hospinian,<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> they read the history
of Esther in their synagogues, and so often as
they hear mention of Haman, they do with
their fists and hammers beat upon the
benches and boards, as if they did knock
upon Haman's head. When thus they have
behaved themselves, in the very time of their
liturgy, like furious and drunken people, the
rest of the day they pass over in outrageous
revelling. And here I take leave of the
Bishop.

days of Purim were instituted to be holidays
or not, yet there was some more than ordinary
warrant for them, because Mordecai,
by whose advice and direction they were appointed
to be kept, was a prophet by the instinct
and revelation of the Spirit, Esth.

only a general warrant, such as the church
hath still, to put order to the circumstances
belonging to God's worship, and all his reason
is, because if the Jews had received any
other particular warrant, the sacred story
should not have passed it over in silence.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Thus much we understand from the

of the dedication of the altar by Judas
Maccabeus, 1. Let us hear what Cartwright

<span class="tei tei-q">“That this feast was unduly instituted
and ungroundly, it may appear by
conference of the dedication of the first
temple under Solomon, and of the second
after the captivity returned from Babylon.
In which dedication, seeing there was no
yearly remembrance by solemnity of feasts,
not so much as one day, it is evident that
the yearly celebration of this feast for eight
days, was not compassed by that Spirit that
Solomon and the captivity were directed by;
which Spirit, when it dwelt more plentifully
in Solomon, and in the prophets that stood
at the stern of the captivity's dedication,
than it did in Judas, it was in him so much
the more presumptuous, as having a shorter
leg than they, he durst in that matter overstride
them, and his rashness is so much the
more aggravated, as each of them, for the
building of the whole temple, with all the
implements and furniture thereof, made no
feast to renew the annual memory, where
Judas only for renewment of the altar, and
of certain other decayed places of the temple,
instituted this great solemnity.”</span>

It is but barely and boldly affirmed by

not rebuked by Christ for this feast, because
we read not so much in Scripture; for there
were many things which Jesus did and said
that are not written in Scripture, John xxi.
25; and whereas it seemeth to some, that
Christ did countenance and approve this
feast, because he gave his presence unto the
same, John x. 22, 23, we must remember,
that the circumstances only of time and
place are noted by the evangelist, for evidence
to the story, and not for any mystery,
Christ had come up to the feast of tabernacles,
John vii., and tarried still all that
while, because then there was a great confluence
of people in Jerusalem. Whereupon
he took occasion to spread the net of the
gospel for catching of many souls. And
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-250">[pg 1-250]</span><a name="Pg1-250" id="Pg1-250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whilst John saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“It was at Jerusalem the
feast of the dedication,”</span> he gives a reason
only of the confluence of many people at
Jerusalem, and showeth how it came to pass
that Christ had occasion to preach to such a
great multitude; and whilst he addeth
<span class="tei tei-q">“And it was winter,”</span> he giveth a reason of
Christ's walking in Solomon's porch, whither
the Jews' resort was. It was not
thought beseeming to walk in the temple
itself, but in the porch men used to convene
either for talking or walking, because
in the summer the porch shadowed them
from the heat of the sun, and in winter it
lay open to the sunshine and to heat. Others
think, that whilst he saith, it was winter,
importeth that therefore Christ was the
more frequently in the temple, knowing that
his time was short which he had then for
his preaching; for in the entry of the next
spring he was to suffer. Howsoever, it is
not certain of what feast of dedication John
speaketh. Bullinger leaves it doubtful;<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> and

taketh the dedication of the altar by Judas
Maccabeus to be meant by John, hath fewest

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had thought here to close this chapter;
but finding that, as the parrot, which other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-251">[pg 1-251]</span><a name="Pg1-251" id="Pg1-251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
while useth the form of a man's voice, yet
being beaten and chaffed, returneth to his
own natural voice, so some of our opposites,
who have been but erst prating somewhat of
the language of Canaan against us, finding
themselves pressed and perplexed in such a
way of reasoning, have quickly changed
their tune, and begin to talk to us of warrants
of another nature nor of the word of
God. I am therefore to digress with them.
And I perceive, ere we know well where
they are, they are passed from Scripture to
custom. For if we will listen, thus saith
one of the greatest note among them,
Bishop Andrews<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> I trow they call him:
<span class="tei tei-q">“We do but make ourselves to be pitied
other while (well said) when we stand
wringing the Scriptures (well said) to strain
that out of them which is not in them (well
said), and so can never come liquid from
them (well said), when yet we have for
the same point the church's custom clear
enough. And that is enough by virtue of
this text”</span> (meaning 1 Cor. xi. 16). And
after he saith, that we are taught by the
Apostle's example in <span class="tei tei-q">“points of this nature,
of ceremony or circumstance, ever to pitch
upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">habemus</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non habemus talem consuetudinem</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. The text gives him no ground
for this doctrine, that in matters of ceremony
we are to pitch upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">habemus</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non
habemus talem consuetudinem</span></span>, so that he
is wide away, whilst he spendeth the greatest
part of his sermon in the pressing of this
point, that the custom of the church should
be enough to us in matters of ceremony, and
particularly in the keeping of Easter; for
the custom of the church there spoken of,
is not concerning a point of circumstance,
but concerning a very substantial and necessary
point, namely, not to be contentious:
neither doth the Apostle urge those orders
of the men's praying uncovered, and the
women's praying veiled, from this ground,
because so was the church's custom (as the
Bishop would have it), but only he is warning
the Corinthians not to be contentious
about those matters, because the churches
have no such custom as to be contentious.
So is the place expounded by Chrysostom,
Ambrose, Calvin, Martyr, Bullinger, Marlorat,
Beza, Fulk, Cartwright, Pareus, and
our own Archbishop of St. Andrews, in his
sermon upon that text. And for this exposition,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-252">[pg 1-252]</span><a name="Pg1-252" id="Pg1-252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it maketh that the Apostle, in the
preceding part of the chapter, hath given
sufficient reasons for that order of covering
or veiling the women; wherefore, if any
would contend about the matter, he tells
them they must contend with themselves;
for they nor the churches of God would not
contend with them,—they had no such custom.
But if we admit Bishop Andrews'
gloss, then why doth the Apostle, after he
hath given good <span class="tei tei-q">“reason for the veiling of
women, subjoin, if any man seem to be contentious,”</span>
&amp;c. The Bishop resolveth us, that
the apostles saw that a wrangling wit would
elude these reasons which he had given,
and he had no other reasons to give, therefore
he resolves all into the church's practice,—enough
of itself to suffice any that
will be wise to sobriety. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> If any seem
to be blasphemous, we have no such custom,
neither the churches of God. What! shall
a wrangling wit elude the reasons given by
the Spirit of God, in such sort, that he must
give some other more sufficient proof for that
which he teacheth? Then the whole Scriptures
of God must yet be better proved, because
the unstable do wrest them, as Peter
speaks, 2 Pet. iii. 16.

6. If it were so that we ought to pitch
upon the church's custom, yet (that I may
speak with Mr Hooker) the law of common
indulgence permitteth us to think of our
own customs as half a thought better than
the customs of others.

But why was there such a change made
in the discipline, policy, and orders of the
church of Scotland, which were agreeable
to the word of God, confirmed and ratified
by general assemblies and parliaments,

the ceremonies out of Scotland, hold them
in elsewhere as it may.

cannot be warranted by the law of

law of man, or power upon earth, can make
them lawful or warrantable unto us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will begin with laws ecclesiastical,
where, first of all, it must be considered well
what power the church hath to make laws
about things pertaining to religion and the
worship of God, and how far the same doth
extend itself. Dr Field's resolution touching
this question is as followeth: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus
(saith he<a id="noteref_876" name="noteref_876" href="#note_876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">876</span></span></a>) we see our adversaries cannot
prove that the church hath power to annex
unto such ceremonies and observations as
she deviseth, the remission of sins, and the
working of other spiritual and supernatural
effects, which is the only thing questioned
between them and us about the power of
the church. So that all the power the
church hath, more than by her power to
publish the commandments of Christ the
Son of God, and by her censures to punish
the offenders against the same, is only in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-255">[pg 1-255]</span><a name="Pg1-255" id="Pg1-255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prescribing things that pertain to comeliness
and order. Comeliness requireth that not
only that gravity and modesty do appear in
the performance of the works of God's service
that beseemeth actions of that nature,
but also that such rites and ceremonies be
used as may cause a due respect unto, and
regard of, the things performed, and thereby
stir men up to greater fervour and devotion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And after: Order requireth that there
be set hours for prayer, preaching, and ministering
the sacraments; that there be silence
and attention when the things are
performed; that women be silent in the
church; that all things be administered according
to the rules of discipline.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This his discourse is but a bundle of incongruities.
For, 1. He saith, that the
church's power to annex unto the ceremonies
which she deviseth the working of spiritual
and supernatural effects, is the only
thing questioned between our adversaries
and us about the power of the church.
Now, our adversaries contend with us also
about the power of the church to make new
articles of faith, and her power to make
laws binding the conscience, both which
controversies are touched by himself.<a id="noteref_877" name="noteref_877" href="#note_877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">877</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. He saith, that comeliness requireth the
use of such ceremonies as may cause a due
respect unto, and regard of, the works of
God's service, and thereby stir men up to
greater fervour and devotion. But it hath
been already showed<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href="#note_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> that the comeliness
which the Apostle requireth in the church
and service of God cannot comprehend
such ceremonies under it, and that it is no
other than that very common external decency
which is beseeming for all the assemblies
of men, as well civil as sacred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Whilst he is discoursing of the
church's power to prescribe things pertaining
to order, contra-distinguished from her
power which she hath to publish the commandments
of Christ, he reckons forth
among his other examples, women's silence
in the church, as if the church did prescribe
this as a matter of order left to her determination,
and not publish it as the commandment
of Christ in his word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Whereas he saith that the church
hath power to prescribe such rites and ceremonies
as may cause a due respect unto,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-256">[pg 1-256]</span><a name="Pg1-256" id="Pg1-256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and regard of, the works of God's service,
and thereby stir men up to greater fervour
and devotion, by his own words shall he be
condemned: for a little before he reprehendeth
the Romanists for maintaining
that the church hath power to annex unto
the ceremonies which she deviseth the working
of spiritual and supernatural effects.
And a little after he saith, that the church
hath no power to ordain such ceremonies as
serve to signify, assure, and convey unto
men such benefits of saving grace as God in
Christ is pleased to bestow on them. Now,
to cause a regard of, and a respect unto the
works of God's service, and thereby to stir
up men to fervour and devotion, what is it
but the working of a spiritual and supernatural
effect, and the conveying unto men
such a benefit of saving grace as God in
Christ is pleased to bestow on them? In
like manner, whereas he holdeth that the
church hath power to ordain such ceremonies
as serve to express those spiritual and
heavenly affections, dispositions, motions, or
desires, which are or should be in men, in
the very same place he confuteth himself,
whilst he affirmeth that the church hath
no power to ordain such ceremonies as serve
to signify unto men those benefits of saving
grace which God in Christ is pleased to bestow
on them. Now, to express such heavenly
and spiritual affections, dispositions,
motions, or desires, as should be in men, is
(I suppose) to signify unto men such benefits
of saving grace, as God in Christ is
pleased to bestow on them. Who dare
deny it?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. Bishop Lindsey's opinion touching
the power of the church,<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href="#note_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a> whereof we
dispute, is, that power is given unto her to
<span class="tei tei-q">“determine the circumstances which are in
the general necessary to be used in divine
worship, but not defined particularly in the
word.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know the church can determine nothing
which is not of this kind and quality. But
the Prelate's meaning (as may be seen in that
same epistle of his) is, that whatsoever the
church determineth, if it be such a circumstance
as is in the general necessary, but not
particularly defined in the word, then we
cannot say that the church had no power to
determine and enjoin the same, nor be led
by the judgment of our own consciences,
judging it not expedient, but that in this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-257">[pg 1-257]</span><a name="Pg1-257" id="Pg1-257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
case we must take the church's law to be the
rule of our consciences. Now, by this ground
which the Prelate holdeth, the church may
prescribe to the ministers of the gospel the
whole habit and apparel of the Levitical
high-priest (which were to Judaize). For
apparel is a circumstance in the general
necessary, yet it is not particularly defined
in the word. By this ground, the church
may determine that I should ever pray with
my face to the east, preach kneeling on my
knees, sing the psalms lying on my back,
and hear sermons standing only upon one
foot. For in all these actions a gesture is
necessary; but there is no gesture particularly
defined in the word to which we are
adstricted in any of these exercises.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And further, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">uno absurdo dato,
mille sequuntur</span></span>, by this ground the Prelate
must say, that the church hath power to
ordain three or four holidays every week
(which ordinance, as he himself hath told
us, could not stand with charity, the inseparable
companion of piety), for time is a
circumstance in the general necessary in
divine worship, yet in his judgment we are
not bound by the word to any particular
time for the performance of the duties of
God's worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By this ground we were to say, that
Pope Innocent III. held him within the
bounds of ecclesiastical power, when in the
great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lateran</span></span> council, anno 1215, he made
a decree, that all the faithful of both sexes
should once in the year at least, to wit, upon
Easter-day, receive the sacrament of the
eucharist. From whence it hath come to
pass, that the common people in the church
of Rome receive the sacrament only upon
Easter. Now, the time of receiving the sacrament
is a circumstance in the general necessary,
for a time it must have, but it is not
particularly defined in the word. It is left
indefinite, 1 Cor. xi. 26, yet the church hath
no power to determine Easter-day, either as
the only time, or as the fittest time, for all
the faithful of both sexes to receive the
eucharist. What if faithful men and women
cannot have time to prepare themselves
as becometh, being avocated and distracted
by the no less necessary than honest adoes
of their particular callings?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What if they cannot have the sacrament
upon that day administered according to our
Lord's institution? What if they see Papists
confirming themselves in their Easter superstition
by our unnecessary practice? Shall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-258">[pg 1-258]</span><a name="Pg1-258" id="Pg1-258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they swallow these and such-like soul-destroying
camels, and all for straining out the
gnat of communicating precisely upon Easter-day?
But since time is a necessary circumstance,
and no time is particularly defined,
the Bishop must say more also, that the
church may determine Easter-day for the
only day whereupon we may receive the
Lord's supper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Last of all, if the church have power to
determine all circumstances in the general
necessary, but not particularly defined in
the word, what could be said against that
ancient order of solemn baptizing only
at the holidays of Easter and Pentecost
(whereby it came to pass that very many
died unbaptized, as Socrates writeth<a id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880" href="#note_880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a>)? Or, what shall be said
against Tertullian's opinion,<a id="noteref_881" name="noteref_881" href="#note_881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">881</span></span></a>
which alloweth lay men, yea, women,
to baptize. May the church's determination
make all this good, forasmuch as these
circumstances of the time when, and the persons
by whom, baptism should be ministered,
are in the general necessary, but not particularly
defined in the word? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ite leves

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Camero,<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href="#note_882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a> as learned a Formalist
as any of the former, expresseth his judgment
copiously touching our present question.
He saith, that there are two sorts of
things which the church commandeth, to
wit, either such as belong to faith and manners,
or such as conduce to faith and manners;
that both are in God's word prescribed
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exserte</span></span>, plainly, but not one way, because
such things that pertain unto faith and
manners, are in the word of God particularly
commanded, whereas those things
which conduce to faith and manners are but
generally commended unto us. Of things
that pertain to faith and manners, he saith,
that they are most constant and certain, and
such as can admit no change; but as for things
conducing to faith and manners, he saith,
that they depend upon the circumstances of
persons, place, and time, which being almost
infinite, there could not be particular precepts
delivered unto us concerning such
things. Only this is from God commended
unto the church, that whatsoever is done
publicly be done with order, and what privately
be decent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These things he so applieth to his purpose,
that he determineth, in neither of these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-259">[pg 1-259]</span><a name="Pg1-259" id="Pg1-259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
kinds the church hath power to make laws,
because in things pertaining to faith and
manners the law of our Lord Jesus Christ
is plainly expressed; and in those things,
wherein neither faith nor manners are
placed, but which conduce to faith and manners,
we have indeed a general law, not having
further any particular law, for that
reason alleged, namely, because this depends
upon the circumstances.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thereafter he addeth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid sit fides,
quid sit pietas, quid sit charitas, verbo

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The matter he illustrates with this one
example: God's word doth define in the
general that we are to fast, and that publicly;
but, in the particular, we could not
have the definition of the word, because
there are infinite occasions of a public fast,
as it is said in the schools, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">individua esse
infinita</span></span>; so that it is the church's part to
look to the occasion, and this depends upon
the consideration of the circumstances. This
discourse of his cannot satisfy the attentive
reader, but deserveth certain animadversions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect</span></span>. 4. First, then, it is to be observed
how he is drawn into a manifest contradiction;
for whereas he saith, that God's word
doth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exserte</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">diserte</span></span> commend unto us
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">generatim</span></span>, such things as conduce to faith
and manners, and that concerning things of
this nature we have a general law in Scripture,
how can this stand with that which he
addeth, namely, that it is in the church's
power to define what things conduce to
faith, piety, and charity, even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">reputando
rem in universum</span></span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Whereas he saith that the church hath
no power to make laws, neither in things
belonging to faith and manners, nor in
things conducing to the same; I would also
see how this agreeth with that other position,
namely, that it is in the power of the
church to define what things do conduce to
faith, piety and charity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. What means he by his application of
order to public, and decency to private actions,
as if the Apostle did not require both
these in the public words of God's service
performed in the church?
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-260">[pg 1-260]</span><a name="Pg1-260" id="Pg1-260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Whereas he saith that such things as
conduce to faith and manners do depend
upon the circumstances, and so could not be
particularly defined in the word, either he
speaks of those things as they are defined
in the general, or as they are defined in the
particular. Not the first; for as they are defined
in the general, they cannot depend upon
changeable circumstances, and that because,
according to his own tenet, the word defines
them in the general, and this definition of
the word is most certain and constant, neither
can any change happen unto it. Wherefore
(without doubt) he must pronounce this
of the definition of such things in the particular.
Now, to say that things conducing
to faith and manners, as they are particularly
defined, do depend upon circumstances,
is as much as to say that circumstances depend
upon circumstances. For things conducing
to faith and manners, which the
church hath power to determine particularly,
what are they other than circumstances?
Surely he who taketh not Camero's
judgment to be, that the church
hath power to determine somewhat more
than the circumstances (and by consequence
a part of the substance) of God's worship,
shall give no sense to his words. Yet, if
one would take his meaning so, I see not
how he can be saved from contradicting
himself; forasmuch as he holdeth that such
things as pertain to faith and manners are
particularly defined in the word. To say
no more, I smell such things in Camero's
opinion as can neither stand with reason nor
with himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. God's word doth not only define
things pertaining to faith and manners, but
also things conducing to the same, and that
not only generally, but in some respects,
and sometimes, particularly. And we take
for example his own instance of fasting.
For the Scripture defineth very many occasions
of fasting; Ezra viii. 21; 2 Chron. xx.;
Jonah iii.; Joel ii.; Acts xiii. 3; Josh. vii.
6; Judg. xx. 16; Esth. iv. 16; Ezra ix. x.;
Zech. vii. From which places we gather that
the Scripture defineth fasting to be used,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. For supplication, when we want some
necessary or expedient good thing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. For deprecation, when we fear some
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. For humiliation, when, by our sins, we
have provoked God's wrath. Neither can
there be any occasion of fasting whereof I
may not say that either it is particularly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-261">[pg 1-261]</span><a name="Pg1-261" id="Pg1-261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
designed in Scripture, or else that it may be
by necessary consequence defined out of
Scripture; or, lastly, that it is of that sort
of things which were not determinable by
Scripture, because circumstances are infinite,
as Camero hath told us.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. Thus having failed by those rocks
of offence, I direct my course straight to the
dissecting of the true limits, within which
the church's power of enacting laws about
things pertaining to the worship of God is
bounded and confined, and which it may
not overleap nor transgress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three conditions I find necessarily requisite
in such a thing as the church hath power
to prescribe by her laws:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1st. It must be only a circumstance of divine
worship; no substantial part of it; no
sacred significant and efficacious ceremony.
For the order and decency left to the definition
of the church, as concerning the particulars
of it, comprehendeth no more but
mere circumstances. Bishop Lindsey<a id="noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href="#note_883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a> doth
but unskilfully confound things different
when he talketh of <span class="tei tei-q">“the ceremonies and
circumstances left to the determination of
the church.”</span> Now, by his leave, though
circumstances be left to the determination of
the church, yet ceremonies, if we speak properly,
are not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bishop Andrews avoucheth<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href="#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a> that ceremonies
pertain to the church only, and to
the service of God, not to civil solemnities.
But so much, I trust, he would not have
said of circumstances which have place in
all moral actions, and that to the same end
and purpose for which they serve in religious
actions, namely, for beautifying them
with that decent demeanour which the very
light and law of natural reason requireth as
a thing beseeming all human actions. For
the church of Christ being a society of men
and women, must either observe order and
decency in all the circumstances of their
holy actions, time, place, person, form, &amp;c.,
or also be deformed with that disorder and
confusion which common reason and civility
abhorreth. Ceremonies, therefore, which
are sacred observances, and serve only to a
religious and holy use, and which may not,
without sacrilege, be applied to another use,
must be sorted with things of another nature
than circumstances. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ceremonioe</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“ceremonies
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-262">[pg 1-262]</span><a name="Pg1-262" id="Pg1-262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Livy thinketh, from a town called Cære, in
the which the Romans did hide their sacred
things when the Gauls invaded Rome.
Others think that ceremonies are so named
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a carendo</span></span>, of abstaining from certain
things, as the Jews abstained from swine's
flesh, and sundry other things forbidden by
God as unclean. Ceremonies are outward
acts of religion,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quapropter etiam</span></span>,
saith Junius,<a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href="#note_886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ritus et ceremonias inter se

against him, that he, and others
with him, do absurdly confound order, decency,
and the like, which have the same
use and praise in civil things which they
have in the worship of God, with religious
and sacred ceremonies. Yet Dr Burges<a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href="#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a>
rejecteth this distinction betwixt circumstances
and ceremonies, as a mere nicety or
fiction. And would you know his reason?
<span class="tei tei-q">“For that (saith he) all circumstances (I
mean extrinsical) which incur not the substance
of the action, when they are once designed
or observed purposely in reference to
such a matter, of whose substance they are

An action sure, or else a nicety. Well,

me it is nice, that the Doctor made it not

lawfully prescribe by her laws and ordinances,
as a thing left to her determination, must
be one of such things as were not determinable
by Scripture, on that reason which
Camero hath given us, namely, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">individua</span></span>
are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infinita</span></span>. We mean not in any
wise to circumscribe the infinite power and
wisdom of God, only we speak upon supposition
of the bounds and limits which God
did set to his written word, within which he
would have it contained, and over which he
thought fit that it should not exceed. The
case being thus put, as it is, we say truly of
those several and changeable circumstances
which are left to the determination of the
church, that, being almost infinite, they
were not particularly determinable in Scripture;
for the particular definition of those
occurring circumstances which were to be
rightly ordered in the works of God's service
to the end of the world, and that ever
according to the exigency of every present
occasion and different case, should have filled
the whole world with books. But as for
other things pertaining to God's worship,
which are not to be reckoned among the
circumstances of it, they being in number
neither many, nor in change various, were
most easily and conveniently determinable
in Scripture. Now, since God would have
his word (which is our rule in the works of
his service) not to be delivered by tradition,
but to be written and sealed unto us, that
by this means, for obviating Satanical subtility,
and succouring human imbecility, we
might have a more certain way for conservation
of true religion, and for the instauration
of it when it faileth among men,—how
can we but assure ourselves that every such
acceptable thing pertaining any way to religion,
which was particularly and conveniently
determinable in Scripture, is indeed
determined in it; and consequently, that no
such thing as is not a mere alterable circumstance
is left to the determination of the
church?

out to be done at all) may be done
conveniently, though it be not (before the
church's prescribing of it) such a thing as
should and ought to be done as convenient.
Which being so, we do still hold that the
conveniency of a thing must always go before
the church's prescribing of it; go before,

come to extract my projection, and to make
it evident that the lawfulness of the controverted
ceremonies cannot be warranted by
any ecclesiastical law; and this I prove by
three arguments:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1st. Those conditions which I have showed
to be required in that thing which the
church may lawfully prescribe by a law, are
not quadrant nor competent to the cross,
kneeling, surplice, holidays, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. They are not mere circumstances,
such as have place in all moral actions, but
sacred, mystical, significant, efficacious ceremonies,
as hath been abundantly shown
in this dispute already. For example, Dr
Burges<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href="#note_895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a>
calleth the surplice a religious or
sacred ceremony. And again,<a id="noteref_896" name="noteref_896" href="#note_896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">896</span></span></a> he placeth
in it a mystical signification of the pureness
of the minister of God. Wherefore the replier<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href="#note_897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a>
to Dr Mortoune's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Particular Defence</span></span>
saith well, that there is a great difference
betwixt a grave civil habit and a mystical
garment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. It cannot be said that these ceremonies
are of that kind of thing which were
not determinable by Scripture; neither will
our opposites, for very shame, adventure to
say that things of this kind, to which cross,
kneeling, &amp;c., do belong, viz., sacred significant
ceremonies, left (in their judgment)
to the definition of the church, are almost
infinite, and therefore could not well and
easily be determined in Scripture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since, then, such things as are not mere
circumstances of worship can neither be
many nor various (as I said before), it is
manifest that all such things were easily determinable
in Scripture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Our ceremonial laws are not backed
with such grounds and reasons as might be
for the satisfying and quieting of tender
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-266">[pg 1-266]</span><a name="Pg1-266" id="Pg1-266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
consciences, but we are borne down with Will

elsewhere.<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href="#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 9. 2d. If the ceremonies be lawful
to us because the law and ordinance of the
church prescribes them, then either the
bare and naked prescription of the church,
having no other warrant than the church's
own authority, makes them to be thus lawful;
or else the law of the church, as
grounded upon and warranted by the law
of God and nature. Not the first; for divines
hold,<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">legem humanum ferri ab hominibus,

upon the mere pleasure of man?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If they take them (as needs they must)
to the latter part, then let them either say
that the ceremonies are lawful unto us, because
the church judgeth them to be agreeable
to the law of God and nature, or because
the church proveth unto us, by evident
reasons, that they are indeed agreeable to
these laws. If they yield us the latter, then
it is not the church's law, but the church's
reasons given for her law, which can warrant
the lawfulness of them unto us, which
doth elude and elide all that which they allege
for the lawfulness of them from the
power and authority of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And further, if any such reasons be to be
given forth for the ceremonies, why are they
so long kept up from us? But if they hold
them at the former, thereupon it will follow,
that it shall be lawful for us to do every
thing which the church shall judge to be
agreeable to the law of God and nature,
and consequently to all the Jewish, popish,
and heathenish ceremonies, yea, to worship
images, if it happen that the church judge
these things to be agreeable to the law of
God and nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be answered (I know), that if the
church command anything repugnant to
God's word we are not bound to do it, nor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-267">[pg 1-267]</span><a name="Pg1-267" id="Pg1-267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to receive it as lawful, though the church
judge so of it; but otherwise, if that which
the church judgeth to be agreeable to the
law of God and nature (and in that respect
prescribeth) be not repugnant to the word
of God, but in itself indifferent, then are we
to embrace it as convenient, and consonant
to the law of God and nature, neither ought
we to call in question the lawfulness of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I reply, that either we must judge a
thing to be repugnant or not repugnant to
the word, to be indifferent or not indifferent
in itself, because the church judgeth
so of it, or else because the church proveth
unto us by an evident reason that it is so.
If the latter, we have what we would; if the
former, we are just where we were: the
argument is still set afoot; then we must
receive everything (be it ever so bad) as indifferent,
if only the church happen so to
judge of it; for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod competit alicui qua
tale</span></span>, &amp;c. So that if we receive anything as
indifferent, for this respect, because the
church judgeth it to be so, then shall we
receive everything for indifferent which the
church shall so judge of.

add anything to the commandments of God
which he hath given unto us, concerning his

Prov. xxx. 6; therefore she may not lawfully
prescribe anything in the works of divine
worship, if it be not a mere circumstance
belonging to that kind of things
which were not determinate by Scripture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our opposites have no other distinctions
which they make any use of against this argument,
but the very same which Papists
use in defence of their unwritten dogmatical
traditions, namely, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">additio corrumpens</span></span>
is forbidden, but not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">additio perficiens</span></span>:
that there is not alike reason of the
Christian church and of the Jewish; that
the church may not add to the essential
parts of God's worship, but to the accidentary
she may add.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the first of those distinctions, we answer,
1. That the distinction itself is an addition
to the word, and so doth but beg the
question.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. It is blasphemous; for it argueth that
the commandments of God are imperfect,
and that by addition they are made perfect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Since our opposites will speak in this
dialect, let them resolve us whether the
washings of the Pharisees, condemned by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-268">[pg 1-268]</span><a name="Pg1-268" id="Pg1-268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christ, were corrupting or perfecting additions.
They cannot say they were corrupting,
for there was no commandment of God
which those washings did corrupt or destroy,
except that commandment which forbiddeth
men's additions. But for this respect our
opposites dare not call them corrupting additions,
for so they should condemn all additions
whatsoever. Except, therefore, they
can show us that those washings were not
added by the Pharisees for perfecting, but
for corrupting the law of God, let them
consider how they rank their own ceremonial
additions with those of the Pharisees.
We read of no other reason wherefore Christ
condemned them but because they were doctrines
which had no other warrant than the
commandments of men, Matt. xv. 9; for
as the law ordained divers washings, for
teaching and signifying that true holiness
and cleanness which ought to be among
God's people, so the Pharisees would have
perfected the law by adding other washings
(and more than God had commanded) for
the same end and purpose.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 11. To the second distinction, we
say that the Christian church hath no more
liberty to add to the commandments of God
than the Jewish church had; for the second
commandment is moral and perpetual, and
forbiddeth to us as well as to them the additions
and inventions of men in the worship
of God. Nay, as Calvin noteth,<a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a> much

of persons by whom, place where,

be performed, the church hath power to define
whatsoever is most expedient, and that
this is a prerogative wherein the Christian
church differeth from the Jewish synagogue,
they do but speak their pleasure in vain,

church hath any more power to add to

For one place not to be appointed
for the worship of God, nor one tribe for the

the distinction which hath been showed betwixt
religious ceremonies and moral circumstances;
for as touching moral circumstances,
which serve for common order and
decency in the worship of God, they being
so many and so alterable, that they could
not be particularly determined in Scripture,
for all the different and almost infinite
cases which might occur, the Jewish synagogue
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-270">[pg 1-270]</span><a name="Pg1-270" id="Pg1-270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had the same power for determining
things of this nature which the church of
Christ now hath. For the law did not define,
but left to be defined by the synagogue,
the set hours for all public divine service,—when
it should begin, how long it should
last, the order that should be kept in the
reading and expounding of the law, praying,
singing, catechising, excommunicating, censuring,
absolving of delinquents, &amp;c., the
circumstances of the celebration of marriage,
of the education of youth in schools and colleges,

But as for ceremonies which are proper to

matter of religion, as Moses for the Jewish;

in the rearing, framing, ordering, and beautifying
of the church, the house of the living
God, he would have less honour and prerogative
given than to his own well-beloved
Son, by whom he hath spoken to us in these
last days, and whom he hath commanded us
to hear in all things? Or that he will accept,
at our hands, any sacred ceremony
which men have presumed to bring into his
holy and pure worship, without the appointment
of his own word and will revealed unto

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 13. As for the third distinction, of
adding to the accidentary parts of it, I remember
that I heard in the logics, of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars
essentialis</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">physica,</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars discreta</span></span>; but of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">para accidentaria</span></span>
heard I never till now. There is (I know)
such a distinction of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars integralis</span></span>, that
it is either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">principalis</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">necessaria</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">minus principalis</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non necessaria</span></span>; but
we cannot understand their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars cultus accidentaria</span></span>
to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars integralis non necessaria</span></span>,
because, then, their distribution of
worship into essential and accidentary parts
could not answer to the rules of a just distribution,
of which one is, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">distributio
debet exhaurire totum distributum</span></span>. Now,
there are some parts of worship which cannot
be comprehended in the foresaid distribution,
namely, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">partes integrales necessarioe</span></span>.
What then? Shall we let this
wild distinction pass, because it cannot be
well nor formally interpreted? Nay, but
we will observe their meaning who make
use of it; for unto all such parts of worship
as are not essential (and which they are
pleased to call accidentary), they hold the
church may make addition, whereunto I
answer, 1. Let them make us understand
what they mean by those essential parts to
which the church may add nothing, and let
them beware lest they give us an identical
description of the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That there are many parts of God's
worship which are not essential, yet such as
will not suffer any addition of the church:
for proof whereof I demand, Were all the
ceremonies commanded to be used in the
legal sacraments and sacrifices essential
parts of those worships? No man will say
so. Yet the synagogue was tied to observe
those (and no other than those) ceremonies
which the word prescribed. When Israel
was again to keep the passover, it was said,
Num. ix. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the fourteenth day of this
month at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed
season, according to all the rites of
it, and according to all the ceremonies of it,
shall ye keep it.”</span> And again, ver. 5, <span class="tei tei-q">“According
to all that the Lord commanded
Moses, so did the children of Israel.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ritibus

worship, which are commanded in the word,
be both necessary to be used <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate

adequate and proportioned to that end, for
which God hath destinated such parts of his

granted by every one who will not accuse
the Scripture of some defect and imperfection),
then it followeth that other accidentary
parts of worship, which the church addeth
thereto, are but superfluous and superstitious.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. I call to mind another logical maxim:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sublata una parte, tolitur totum.</span></span> An essential
part being taken away, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">totum essentiale</span></span>
is taken away also. In like manner,
an integrant part being taken away, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">totum
integrum</span></span> cannot remain behind. When a
man hath lost his hand or his foot, though
he be still a man physically, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">totum essentiale</span></span>,
yet he is not a man mathematically,
he is no longer <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">totum integrale</span></span>. Just so
if we reckon any additions (as the cross,
kneeling, holidays, &amp;c.) among the parts of
God's worship, then put the case, that those
additions were taken away, it followeth that
all the worship which remaineth still will
not be the whole and entire worship of God,
but only a part of it, or at the best, a defective,
wanting, lame, and maimed worship.

of our opposites, which is the king's majesty's
supremacy in things ecclesiastical. If
they did mean, in good earnest, to qualify
the lawfulness of the ceremonies from holy
Scripture, why have they not taken more
pains and travail to debate the matter from
thence? And if they meant to justify
them by the laws and constitutions of the
church, why did they not study to an orderly
peaceable proceeding, and to have
things concluded in a lawful national synod,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-274">[pg 1-274]</span><a name="Pg1-274" id="Pg1-274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after free reasoning and mature advisement?
Why did they carry matters
so factiously and violently? The truth is,
they would have us to acquiesce, and to say
no more against the ceremonies, when once
we hear that they are enjoined by his Majesty,
our only supreme governor. What I
am here to say shall not derogate anything
from his Highness's supremacy, because it
includeth no such thing as a nomothetical
power to prescribe and appoint such sacred
and significant ceremonies as he shall think
good.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Archbishop of Armagh, in his speech
which he delivered concerning the King's
supremacy (for which king James returned
him, in a letter, his princely and gracious
thanks, for that he had defended his just
and lawful power with so much learning and
reason), whilst he treateth of the supremacy,
and expoundeth that title of <span class="tei tei-q">“the only supreme
governor of all his Highness's dominions
and countries, as well in all spiritual or
ecclesiastical things or causes, as temporal,”</span>
mentioneth no such thing as any power to
dispose, by his laws and ordinances, of
things external in the worship of God.
Neither yet shall this following discourse
tend to the cooling and abating of that care
and zeal which princes owe to the oversight
and promotion of religion. For alas! the
corruptions which have stept into religion,
and the decays which it hath felt since
princes began to take small thought of it,
and to leave the care of it to popes, bishops,
monks, &amp;c., can never be enough bewailed.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. Now, for the purpose in hand,
we will first examine what the Archbishop
of Spalato saith; for he discourseth much
of the jurisdiction and office of princes, in
things and causes ecclesiastical. The title
of the first chapter of his sixth book, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
Rep. Eccl.</span></span>, holdeth, that it is the duty of
princes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">super ecclesiastica invigilare</span></span>; but
in the body of the chapter he laboureth to
prove that the power of governing ecclesiastical
things belongeth to princes (which is
far more than to watch carefully over them).
This the reader will easily perceive. Nay,
he himself, num. 115 and 174, professeth
he hath been proving, that divine and ecclesiastical
things are to be ruled and governed
by the authority and laws of princes. The
title prefixed to the sixth chapter of that
same book is this, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Legibus et edictis principum
laicorum, et ecclesiastica et ecclesiasticos
gubernari</span></span>. So that in both chapters
he treateth of one and the same office
of princes about things ecclesiastical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, if we would learn what he means
by those <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiastica</span></span> which he will have
to be governed by princes, he resolves us<a id="noteref_919" name="noteref_919" href="#note_919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a>
that he means not things internal, such as
the deciding of controversies in matters of
faith, feeding with the word of God, binding
and loosing, and ministering of the sacraments
(for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in pure spiritualibus</span></span>, as he
speaketh in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Summa</span></span>, cap. 5,) he yieldeth
them not the power of judging and defining,
but only things external, which pertain
to the external worship of God, or concern
external ecclesiastical discipline; such things
he acknowledged to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">res
spirituales</span></span>;<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a>
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vera spiritualia</span></span> he will have to comprehend
only things internal, which he removeth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-276">[pg 1-276]</span><a name="Pg1-276" id="Pg1-276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the power of princes. Thus
we have his judgment as plain as himself
hath delivered it unto us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. But I demand, 1. Why yieldeth
he the same power to princes in governing
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiastica</span></span> which he yieldeth them in governing
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiasticos</span></span>? For ecclesiastical
persons, being members of the commonwealth
no less than laics, have the same
king and governor with them, for which
reason it is (as the Bishop himself showeth
out of Molina<a id="noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href="#note_921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a>) that they are bound to be
subject to their prince's laws, which pertain
to the whole commonwealth. But the like
cannot be alleged, for the power of princes
to govern <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiastica</span></span>, for the Bishop, I
trust, would not have said that things ecclesiastical
and things civil do equally and alike
belong to their power and jurisdiction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Why confoundeth he the governing of
things and causes ecclesiastical with watching
over and taking care for the same? Let
us only call to mind the native signification
of the word Κυβεριάω, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">guberno</span></span> signifieth
properly to rule or govern the course of a
ship; and in a ship there may be many
watchful and careful eyes over her course,
and yet but one governor directing the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Why holdeth he that things external
in the worship of God are not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vera spiritualia</span></span>?
For if they be ecclesiastical and sacred
ceremonies (not fleshly and worldly),
why will he not also acknowledge them for
true spiritual things? And if they be not
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vera spiritualia</span></span>, why calls he them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">res
spirituales</span></span>? for are not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">res</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verum</span></span> reciprocal

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Even as a prince in his sea voyage is
supreme governor of all which are in the
ship with him, and, by consequence, of the
governor who directs her course, yet doth
he not govern the actions of governing or
directing the course of a ship, so, though a
prince be the only supreme governor of all
his dominions, and, by consequence, of ecclesiastical
persons in his dominions, yet he
cannot be said to govern all their ecclesiastical
actions and causes. And as the governor
of a ship acknowledgeth his prince for
his only supreme governor even then whilst
he is governing and directing the course of
the ship (otherwise whilst he is governing
her course he should not be his prince's subject),
yet he doth not thereby acknowledge
that his prince governeth his action of directing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-277">[pg 1-277]</span><a name="Pg1-277" id="Pg1-277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the course of the ship (for then
should the prince be the pilot); so when
one hath acknowledged the prince to be the
only supreme governor upon earth of all
ecclesiastical persons in his dominions, even
whilst they are ordering and determining
ecclesiastical causes, yet he hath not thereby
acknowledged that the prince governeth the
ecclesiastical causes. Wherefore, whilst the
Bishop<a id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922" href="#note_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a> taketh the English oath of supremacy
to acknowledge the same which he
teacheth touching the prince's power, he
giveth it another sense than the words of it
can bear; for it saith not that the king's
majesty is the only supreme governor of all
his Highness's dominions, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></em> all things
and causes therein, as well ecclesiastical or
spiritual as temporal,—but it saith that
he is the only supreme governor of all his
Highness's dominions in all things or causes,
&amp;c. Now, the spiritual guides of the church,
substituted by Christ as deputies in his
stead, who is the most supreme Governor of
his own church, and on whose shoulder the
government resteth, Isa. ix. 6, as his royal
prerogative, even then, whilst they are governing
and putting order to ecclesiastical
or spiritual causes, they acknowledge their
prince to be their only supreme governor
upon earth, yet hereby they imply not that
he governeth their governing of ecclesiastical
causes, as hath been shown by that simile
of governing a ship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. 5. Whereas the Bishop leaveth
all things external, which pertain to the
worship of God, to be governed by princes,
I object, that the version of the holy Scripture
out of Hebrew and Greek into the vulgar
tongue is an external thing, belonging
to the worship of God, yet it cannot be governed
by a prince who is not learned in the
original tongues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Whereas he yieldeth to princes the
power of governing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in spiritualibus</span></span>, but not
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in pure spiritualibus</span></span>, I cannot comprehend
this distinction. All sacred and ecclesiastical
things belonging to the worship of God are
spiritual things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What, then, understands he by things
purely spiritual? If he mean things which
are in such sort spiritual, that they have nothing
earthly nor external in them,—in this
sense the sacraments are not purely spiritual,
because they consist of two parts; one
earthly, and another heavenly, as Rheneus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-278">[pg 1-278]</span><a name="Pg1-278" id="Pg1-278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saith of the eucharist;—and so the sacraments,
not being things purely spiritual,
shall be left to the power and government
of princes. If it be said that by things
purely spiritual he means things which concern
our spirits only, and not the outward
man, I still urge the same instance; for the
sacraments are not in this sense spiritual,
because a part of the sacraments, to wit, the
sacramental signs or elements, concern our
external and bodily senses of seeing, touching,
and tasting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The Bishop also contradicteth himself
unawares; for in one place<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href="#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a> he reserveth
and excepteth from the power of princes
the judging and deciding of controversies
and questions of faith. Yet in another
place<a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href="#note_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a>
he exhorteth kings, and princes to
compel the divines of both sides (of the
Roman and reformed churches) to come to
a free conference, and to debate the matters
controverted betwixt them; in which
conference he requireth the princes themselves
to be judges.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. It remaineth to try what force
of reason the Bishop hath to back his opinion.
As for the ragged rabble of human
testimonies which he raketh together, I
should but weary my reader, and spend
paper and ink in vain, if I should insist to
answer them one by one. Only thus much
I say of all those sentences of the fathers
and constitutions of princes and emperors
about things ecclesiastical, together with the
histories of the submission of some ecclesiastical
causes to emperors,—let him who pleaseth
read them; and it shall appear,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. That some of those things whereunto
the power of princes was applied were unlawful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. There were many of them things temporal
or civil, not ecclesiastical or spiritual,
nor such as pertain to the worship of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. There were some of them ecclesiastical
or spiritual things, but then princes did
only ratify that which had been determined
by councils, and punish with the civil sword
such as did stubbornly disobey the church's
lawful constitutions. Neither were princes
allowed to do any more.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Sometimes they interposed their authority,
and meddled in causes spiritual or
ecclesiastical, even before the definition of
councils; yet did they not judge nor decide
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-279">[pg 1-279]</span><a name="Pg1-279" id="Pg1-279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those matters, but did only convocate councils,
and urge the clergy to see to the mis-ordered
and troubled state of the church,
and by their wholesome laws and ordinances,
to provide the best remedies for the same
which they could.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. At other times princes have done
somewhat more in ecclesiastical matters; but
this was only in extraordinary cases, when
the clergy were so corrupted, that either
through ignorance they were unable, or
through malice and perverseness unwilling,
to do their duty in deciding of controversies,
making of canons, using the keys, and managing
of other ecclesiastical matters, in
which case princes might and did, by their
coactive temporal jurisdiction, avoid disorder,
error, and superstition, and cause a reformation
of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Princes have likewise, in rightly constituted
and well reformed churches, by their
own regal authority, straitly enjoined things
pertaining to the worship of God, but those
things were the very same which God's
own written word had expressly commanded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. When princes went beyond those limits
and bounds, they took upon them to
judge and command more than God hath
put within the compass of their power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. But as touching the passages of
holy Scripture which the Bishop allegeth,
I will answer thereto particularly. And
first, he produceth that place, Deut. xvii.
19, where the king was appointed to have
the book of the law of God with him, that
he might learn to fear the Lord his God,
and to keep all the words of this law and
these statutes to do them. What logic, I
pray, can from this place infer that princes
have the supreme power of governing all
ecclesiastical causes? Next, the Bishop tells
us of David's appointing of the offices of
the Levites, and dividing of their courses,
1 Chron. xxiii and his commending of the
same to Solomon, 1 Chron. xxviii.; but he
might have observed that David did not
this as a king, but as a prophet, or man of
God, 2 Chron. viii. 14, yea, those orders
and courses of the Levites were also commanded
by other prophets of the Lord,
2 Chron. xxix. 25. As touching Solomon's
appointing of the courses and charges of the
priests, Levites, and porters, he did not of
himself, nor by his own princely authority,
but because David, the man of God, had
so commanded, 2 Chron. viii. 24. For Solomon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-280">[pg 1-280]</span><a name="Pg1-280" id="Pg1-280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
received from David a pattern for
all that which he was to do in the work of
the house of the Lord, and also for the
courses of the priests and Levites, 1 Chron.
xxviii. 11-13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. The Bishop comes on and tells
us that Hezekiah did apply his regal power
to the reformation of the Levites, and of
the worship of God in their hands, saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves,
and sanctify the house of the Lord
God of your fathers, and carry forth the
filthiness out of the holy place.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> He exhorted them to no more
than God's law required of them, for the
law ordained them to sanctify themselves,
and to do the service of the house of the
Lord, Num. viii. 6, 11, 15; xviii. 32;
so that Hezekiah did here constitute nothing
by his own arbitration and authority,
but plainly showeth his warrant, ver. 11,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord hath chosen you to stand before
him, to serve him, and that you should minister
unto him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Bishop further allegeth out of 2
Chron. xxxi. that Hezekiah appointed the
courses of the priests and Levites, every
man according to his service.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> He might have read 2 Chron. xxix.,
25, that Hezekiah did all this according to
the commandment of David, and of Gad,
the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet,
<span class="tei tei-q">“For so was the commandment of the Lord
by his prophets.”</span> And who doubteth but
kings may command such things as God
hath commanded before them?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 8. The next example which the
Bishop allegeth is out of 2 Chron. xxxv.
where we read that Josias did set the priests
and Levites again in their charges, which
example cannot prove that kings have the
supreme power of governing ecclesiastical
causes, unless it be evinced that Josias
changed those orders and courses of the Levites
and priests which the Lord had commanded
by his prophets, 2 Chron. xxix.
25, and that he did institute other orders
by his own regal authority, whereas the
contrary is manifest from the text; for
Josias did only set the priests and Levites
those charges and courses which had been
assigned unto them after the writing of
David and Solomon, ver. 4, and by the
commandment of David, and Asaph, and
Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer,
ver. 15. Neither did Josias command the
priests and Levites any other service than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-281">[pg 1-281]</span><a name="Pg1-281" id="Pg1-281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that which was written in the book of Moses,
ver. 12; so that, from his example, it only
followeth, that when princes see the state of
ecclesiastical persons corrupted, they ought
to interpose their authority for reducing
them to those orders and functions which
God's word commandeth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 9. Moreover, the Bishop objecteth
the example of Joash, who, while he yet did
right in the days of Jehoiada the priest,
2 Chron. xxiv. sent the priests and Levites
to gather from all Israel money for repairing
the house of the Lord, and when they
dealt negligently in this business, he transferred
the charge of the same unto others,
and, making himself the keeper of the holy
money, did both prescribe how it was to be
disbursed, and likewise take from good Jehoiada
the priest the administration of the
same. Now, where he hath read that Joash
made himself the keeper of the money, and
prescribed how it should be disbursed, also
that he took the administration from Jehoiada,
I cannot guess; for the text hath no
such thing in it, but the contrary, viz. that
the king's scribe, and the high priest's officer,
kept the money, and disbursed the
same, as the king and Jehoiada prescribed
unto them. As to that which he truly allegeth
out of the holy text, I answer, 1.
The collection for repairing the house of the
Lord was no human ordinance, for Joash
showeth the commandment of Moses for it,
ver. 6, having reference to Exod. xxx.
12-14. No other collections did Joash
impose but those <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quae divino jure
debebantur</span></span>.<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="#note_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a>
2. As for the taking of the charge
of this collection from the priests, he behooved
to do so, because they had still neglected
the work, when the twenty-third
year of his reign was come. And so say we,
that when the ministers of the church fail to
do their duty, in providing that which is
necessary for the service of God, princes
ought by some other means to cause these
things be redressed. 3. Joash did nothing
with these monies without Jehoiada, but
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pontifex eas primum laborantibus tribuit,
tum in aedis sacrae restaurationem maxime
convertit</span></span>.<a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926" href="#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> 4. And what if he had done
this by himself? I suppose no man will
reckon the hiring of masons and carpenters
with such as wrought iron and brass, or the
gathering of money for this purpose, among
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-282">[pg 1-282]</span><a name="Pg1-282" id="Pg1-282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spiritual things or causes. 5. And if these
employments about Solomon's temple were
not to be called spiritual or ecclesiastical,
far less about our material churches, which
are not holy nor consecrated as Solomon's
was for a typical use. Wherefore, without
all prejudice to our cause, we may and do
commend the building and repairing of
churches by Christian princes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 10. But the Bishop returneth to
another example in Solomon, which is the
putting of Abiathar, the chief priest, from
his office, and surrogating of another in his
place. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Abiathar was civilly dead, as
the lawyers used to speak, and it was only
by accident or by consequent that Solomon
put him from his office: he sent him away
to Anathoth, because of his treasonable following
and aiding of Adonijah, whereupon
necessarily followed his falling away from
the honour, dignity, and office of the high
priest, whence it only followeth, that if a
minister be found guilty of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">læse</span></span> majesty,
the king may punish him either with banishment
or proscription, or some such civil
punishment, whereupon by consequence will
follow his falling from his ecclesiastical office
and dignity. 2. As for Solomon's putting
of Zadok in the room of Abiathar, it maketh
as little against us, for Zadok did fall to
the place <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The honour and office of the high-priesthood
was given to Eleazar, the elder son of
Aaron, and was to remain in his family.
How it came to pass that it was transferred
to Eli, who was of the family of Ithmar, we
read not. Always after that Abiathar, who
was of the family of Ithamar and descended
of Eli, had by a capital crime fallen from it,
it did of very right belong to Zadok, who
was chief of the family of Eleazar. And so
all this flowed, not from Solomon's, but from
God's own authority.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 11. The Bishop remembereth another
example in Hezekiah too, telling us
that he removed the high places, and brake
the images, and cut down the groves, and
brake in pieces the brazen serpent, when the
children of Israel did burn incense unto it.
Now, we wish from our hearts that from
this example all Christian kings may learn
to remove and destroy the monuments of
idolatry out of their dominions. And if it
be said that in so doing kings take upon
them to govern by their princely authority
an ecclesiastical or spiritual cause, it is easily
answered, that when they destroy idolatrous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-283">[pg 1-283]</span><a name="Pg1-283" id="Pg1-283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
monuments, they do nothing by their own
authority, but by the authority of God's law,
which commanded to abolish such monuments,
and to root out the very names of
idols; which commandment is to be executed
by the action of temporal power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 12. Finally, saith the Bishop, the
kings of the Jews, 1 Kings xxiii.; 2 Chron.
xix.; have in the temple propounded the
law of the Lord to the people, renewed the
covenant of religion, pulled down profane
altars, broken down idols, slain idolatrous
priests, liberated their kingdom from abomination,
purged the temple, 2 Chron. xxxiv.,
xxxv.; 1 Maccab. iv. 59; proclaimed the
keeping of the passover, and of the feast of
dedication, Esth. ix. 26 ; and have also instituted
new feasts. For all which things
they are in the Scriptures much praised by
the Holy Spirit, 2 Chron. xxix. 2; xxxiv.
2, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> True it is, Josias did read the law
of the Lord to the people in the temple, and
made a covenant before the Lord; but, 1.
he prescribed nothing at his own pleasure;
only he required of the people to walk after
the Lord, and to keep his commandments.
2. Neither did he this work by himself, but
did convocate a council of the prophets,
priests and elders of Israel, for the advancing
of that reformation, 2 Kings xxiii. 1.
3. And if he had done it by himself, yet we
are to remember that the reformation of a
church generally and greatly corrupted,
craveth the more immediate intermeddling
of princes, and a great deal more than can
be ordinarily and orderly done by them in a
church already reformed. The slaying of
the idolatrous priests had also the warrant
and authority of the law of God, which appointed
a capital punishment for blasphemers,<a id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href="#note_927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a>
or such as, in contempt of God and to
rub some ignominy upon his name, did traduce
his doctrine and religion, and either
detract from him, and attribute to idols that
which appertained properly unto him, or
else attributed unto him either by enunciation
or imprecation, such things as could not
stand with the glory of the Godhead. Concerning
the abolishing of idolatry and all the
relics thereof, we have answered that it was
commanded by God. The keeping of the
passover was also commanded in the law;
but publish God's own express ordinance.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-284">[pg 1-284]</span><a name="Pg1-284" id="Pg1-284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Last of all, touching two remaining examples:
1. The feast of the dedication was
not ordained by the sole authority of Judas,
but by his brethren and by the whole congregation
of Israel;<a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928" href="#note_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> and the days of Purim
were established by Mordecai, a prophet.
Esth. ix. 20, 21. 2. We have elsewhere
made it evident, that the days of Purim, by
their first institution, were only days of civil
joy and solemnity, and that the feast of the
dedication was not lawfully instituted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 13. Thus having dismissed the Bishop,
we will make us for clearing the purpose
in hand. But before we come to show
particularly what princes may do, and what
they may not do, in making laws about
things ecclesiastical, we will first of all lay
down these propositions following:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Whatsoever the power of princes be in
things and causes ecclesiastical, it is not,
sure, absolute nor unbounded. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Solius Dei
est</span></span> (saith Stapleton),<a id="noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">juxta suam sanctissimam
voluntatem, uctiunes suas omnes
dirigere, et omniafacere quæcunquc voluit.</span></span>
And again, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vis tuam voluntatem esse regulam
rerum omnium, ut omnia fiant pro
uuo beneplacito?</span></span> Whether we respect the
persons or the places of princes, their power
is confined within certain limits, so that they
may not enjoin whatsoever they list. As
touching their poisons, Bishop Spotswood
would do no less than warrant the articles
of Perth by king James's personal qualities:
<span class="tei tei-q">“His person (saith he<a id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href="#note_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a>), were he not our
sovereign, gives them sufficient authority,
being recommended by him; for he knows
the nature of things, and the consequences
of them, what is fit for a church to have,
and what not, better than we do all.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I mean not to derogate anything from
king James's duly-deserved praise, nor to
obscure his never-dying memory; only I
say, that such a prince as the Bishop speaketh
of, who knoweth what is fit for a church
to have, and what not, better than many
learned and godly pastors assembled in a
synod, is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rara avis in terris nigroque
simillima Cygno</span></span>. For a prince being but a
man, and so subject to error, being but one
man, and so in the greater hazard of error;
for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">plus videns oculi, quam oculus</span></span>; and,
<span class="tei tei-q">“woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for
he hath not another to help him up,”</span> saith
the wisest of mortal kings, Eccl. iv. 10; being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-285">[pg 1-285]</span><a name="Pg1-285" id="Pg1-285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also compassed or assailed with so many tentations
which other men are free of; and
lastly, being so taken up and distracted with
secular affairs and cares, that very seldom
is he found well versed or singularly learned
in the controversies of religion; may not
such a one, in the common sense of Christians,
be thought more like to fail and miscarry
in his judgment about things ecclesiastical,
than a whole synod, wherein there
are many of the learned, judicious, and godly
ministers of the church. Papists tell us,
that they will not defend the personal actions
of the Pope, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quasi ipse solus omnibus
horis sapere potuerit, id quod recte nemini
concessum perhibetur</span></span>.<a id="noteref_931" name="noteref_931" href="#note_931"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">931</span></span></a> Their own records
let the world know the abominable vices
and impieties of popes. Witness Platina,
in the life of John X., Benedict IV., John
XIII., Boniface VII., John XX., John
XXII., Paul II., &amp;c. And further, when
our adversaries dispute of the Pope's infallibility,
they grant, for his own person, he
may be an heretic, only they hold that he
cannot err <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">è cathedra</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And shall we now idolise the persons of
princes more than Papists do the persons
of popes? Or shall Papists object to us,
that we extol the judgment of our princes
to a higher degree of authority and infallibility
than they yield to the judgment of
their popes? Alas, why would we put the
weapons in the hands of our adversaries!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 14. But what say we of princes in respect
of their place and calling? Is not their
power absolute in that respect? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Recte quidam</span></span>

pertaining to external order in religion, kings
may command what they will <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro authoritate</span></span>,

that when they command <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">frivola, dura, et

bound by those their frivolous and unjust
commandments, not only in respect of the
end, because scandal should possibly follow
in case we obey them not, but also <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jubentis

the reading of these passages in Saravia and
Camero, horror and amazement have taken
hold on me. O wisdom of God, by whom
kings do reign and princes decree justice,
upon whose thigh and vesture is written,
<span class="tei tei-q">“King of kings and Lord of lords,”</span> make
the kings of the earth to know that their
laws are but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regulae regulatae</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mensurae
mensuratae</span></span>! Be wise now, therefore,
O ye kings, be instructed ye judges of the
earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice
with trembling. Kiss the Son, and lay
down your crowns at the feet of the Lamb
that sits upon the throne,<a id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934" href="#note_934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">discite justitiam

of wisdom, by casting pride away, to
addict yourselves to the dominion of Christ,
who, albeit he hath given the kingdoms of
this world unto your hands, and non <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">auferet
mortalia, qui regna datio caelestia</span></span>, yet
hath he kept the government of his church
upon his own shoulder, Psalm ix. 6, xxii. 21.
So that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rex non est propie rector ecclesiae sed

all ye subjects of kings and princes, understand
that in things pertaining to the church
and kingdom of Christ, ye are not the servants
of men, to do what they list, and that
for their listing, 1 Cor. vii. 23. The Apostle,
Rom. xiii. urgeth, not obedience to magistrates
for conscience' sake, but only subjection
for conscience' sake, for he concludeth his
whole purpose,<a id="noteref_935" name="noteref_935" href="#note_935"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">935</span></span></a> ver. 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“Render therefore

person, but even into his chair, when being
entered in the conclave for the election of a
new pope, they spend the whole day following
in the making of laws belonging to the
administration and handling of all things by
him who shall be advanced to the popedom;
which laws every one of them subscribeth,
and sweareth to observe, if he be made pope,
as Onephrius writeth. Though the Pope's

after the roving absurdities of some
opposites. Now, therefore, to return,—the
second proposition which I am here to lay
down, before I speak particularly of the
power of princes, is this: Whatsoever
princes can commendably either do by
themselves, or command to be done by
others, in such matters as any way appertain
to the external worship of God, must
be both lawful in the nature of it, and expedient
in the use of it; which conditions,
if they be wanting, their commandments
cannot bind to obedience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. The very ground and reason
wherefore we ought to obey the magistrate<a id="noteref_939" name="noteref_939" href="#note_939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a>
is, for that he is the minister of God, or a
deputy set in God's stead to us. Now, he
is the minister of God only for our good,
Rom. xiii. 4. Neither were he God's minister,
but his own master, if he should rule
at his pleasure, and command things which
serve not for the good of the subjects.
Since, therefore, the commandments of
princes bind only so far as they are the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-288">[pg 1-288]</span><a name="Pg1-288" id="Pg1-288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ministers of God for our good,—and God's
ministers they are not in commanding such
things as are either in their nature unlawful,
or in their use inconvenient,—it followeth
that such commandments of theirs cannot
bind.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Princes cannot claim any greater power
in matters ecclesiastical than the apostle
Paul had, or the church herself yet hath;
that is to say, princes may not by any temporal
or regal jurisdiction, urge any ceremony
or form of ecclesiastical policy which
the Apostle once might not, and the church
yet may not, urge by a spiritual jurisdiction.
But neither had the Apostle of old, nor
hath the church now, power to urge either
a ceremony or anything else which is not
profitable for edifying. Paul could do nothing
against the truth, but for the truth;
and his power was given to him to edification,
and not to destruction, 2 Cor. xiii. 8,
10; neither shall ecclesiastical persons, to
the world's end, receive any other power
beside that which is for the perfecting of
the saints, and for the edifying of the body
of Christ, Eph. iv. 12. Therefore, as the
church's power<a id="noteref_940" name="noteref_940" href="#note_940"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a> is only to prescribe that
which may edify, so the power of princes is
in like sort given to them for edification,
and not for destruction; neither can they
do aught against the truth, but only for the
truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. We are bound by the law of God to
do nothing which is not good and profitable,
or edifying, 1 Cor. vi. 12; xiv. 26. This
law of charity is of a higher and straiter
bond than the law of any prince in the
world:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The general rule of all indifferent things,

his neighbour to edification, even as Christ
pleased not himself but others.’</span> Whatsoever,
then, is of this rank, which either
would weaken or not edify our brother, be
it ever so lawful, ever so profitable to ourselves,
ever so powerfully by earthly authority
enjoined,—Christians, who are not born

which is this, Since the power of princes to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-289">[pg 1-289]</span><a name="Pg1-289" id="Pg1-289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
make laws about things ecclesiastical is not
absolute, but bound and adstricted unto things
lawful and expedient, which sort of things,
and no other, we are allowed to do for their
commandments; and since princes many
times may, and do, not only transgress those
bounds and limits, but likewise pretend that
they are within the same, when indeed they
are without them, and enjoin things unlawful
and inconvenient, under the name, title,
and show of things lawful and convenient;
therefore it is most necessary as well for
princes to permit, as for subjects to take liberty
to try and examine by the judgment
of discretion, everything which authority
enjoineth, whether it be agreeable or repugnant
to the rules of the word; and if, after
trial, it be found repugnant, to abstain from
the doing of the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. The word teacheth us, that the
spiritual man judgeth all things, 1 Cor. ii.
15; trieth the things that are different,
Phil. i. 10; hath his senses exercised to discern
both good and evil, Heb. v. 14; and
that every one who would hold fast that
which is good, and abstain from all appearance
of evil, must first prove all things, 1
Thess. v. 21.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Whatsoever is not of faith is sin, Rom.
xiv. 23. But whatsoever a man doth without
the trial, knowledge, and persuasion of
the lawfulness of it by the word of God, that
is not of faith; therefore a sin. It is the word
of God, and not the arbitration of princes
whereupon faith is grounded. And though
the word may be without faith, yet faith cannot
be without the word. By it therefore
must a man try and know assuredly the lawfulness
of that which he doth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-q">“Every one of us shall give account of
himself to God.”</span> But as we cannot give an
account to God of those actions which we
have done in obedience to our prince, except
we have examined, considered, and understood
the lawfulness of the same; so an
account could not be required of us for them,
if we were bound to obey and to keep all his
ordinances in such sort that we might not
try and examine them, with full liberty to
refuse those which we judge out of the word
to be unlawful or inconvenient; for then
princes' ordinances were a most sufficient
warrant to us: we needed try no more.
Let him make an account to God of his
command; we have account to make of our
obedience.

4. If we be bound to receive and obey the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-290">[pg 1-290]</span><a name="Pg1-290" id="Pg1-290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
laws of princes, without making a free trial
and examining of the equity of the same,
then we could not be punished for doing,
unwillingly and in ignorance, things unlawful
prescribed by them. Whereas every soul
that sinneth shall die; and when the blind
leads the blind, he who is lead falls in the
ditch as well as his leader.

5. No man is permitted to do everything
which seemeth right in his eyes, and to follow
every conceit which takes him in the
head; but every man is bound to walk by
rule, Gal. vi. 6. But the law of a prince
cannot be a rule, except it be examined
whether it be consonant to the word of God,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">index secundum legem</span></span>, and his law is only
such a rule as is ruled by a higher rule. In
so far as it is ruled by the own rule of it, in
as far it is a rule to us; and in so far as it
is not ruled by the own rule of it, in as far
it is not a rule to us. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid ergo? an non

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The rule whereby we ought to walk in
all our ways, and according to which we
ought to frame all our actions, is provided
of God a stable and sure rule, that it being
observed and taken heed unto, may guide
and direct our practice aright about all those
things which it prescribeth. But the law of
a prince (if we should, without trial and examination,
take it for our rule) cannot be
such a stable and sure rule. For put the
case that a prince enjoin two things which
sometimes fall out to be incompatible and
cannot stand together, in that case his law
cannot direct our practice, nor resolve us
what to do; whereas God hath so provided
for us, that the case can never occur wherein
we may not be resolved what to do if we
observe the rule which he hath appointed
us to walk by.

7. Except this judgment of discretion
which we plead for be permitted unto us, it
will follow that in point of obedience we
ought to give no less, but as much honour
unto princes as unto God himself. For when
God publisheth his commandments unto us,
what greater honour could we give him by
our obedience than to do that which he
commandeth, for his own sole will and authority,
without making further inquiry for
any other reason?

things for which we have no other warrant
beside the pleasure and will of men. Which
interpretation is grounded upon other places
of Scripture, that teach us we are not bound
to obey men in anything which we know not
to be according to the will of God, Eph. vi.
6, 7; that we ought not to live to the lusts
of men, but to the will of God, 1 Pet. iv. 2,

9. They who cleanse their way must take

children of light, must have the word for a
lamp unto their feet, and a light unto their
path, Psal. cxix. 105; therefore, if we go
in any path without the light of the word
to direct us, we walk in darkness and stumble,
because we see not where we go. They
who would not be unwise, but walk circumspectly,
must understand what the will of
Lord is, Eph. v. 17; therefore, if we

bind the subject, but only with this
condition, except he would compel him to
that which is unlawful. Therefore there is
ever left unto subjects a power of proving
and judging in their own mind, whether that
which is propounded be ungodly and unlawful
or not; and if it be ungodly, that which the
king threateneth should be suffered, rather
than that which he commandeth be done.

to be done or to be believed by him; but
only he maketh himself the judge of his own
actions. For howsoever he who playeth the
judge is truly said to judge, yet every one
who judgeth is not properly said to play the

external court pronounceth a sentence, which
by force of jurisdiction toucheth another;
but he judgeth, who in the inferior court of
his own private conscience, conceiveth such a
sentence of the things to be believed or done,

way private men both may and ought to

but saith so much as inferreth the necessity
of this judgment of private and practical
discretion; for every smatterer among
them hath this much in his mouth, that if
the king or the church command anything
unlawful, then we ought to obey God rather
than men; but when they command
things indifferent and lawful, then their ordinance
ought to be our rule. But (good
men) will they tell us how we shall know
whether the things which the king or the
church (as they speak) do enjoin are lawful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-293">[pg 1-293]</span><a name="Pg1-293" id="Pg1-293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or unlawful, indifferent or not indifferent?
and so we shall be at a point. Dare they
say, that they may judge those things indifferent
which our superiors judge to be such?
and those unlawful which our superiors so
judge of? Nay, then, they should deliver
their distinction in other terms, and say
thus: If our superiors enjoin anything which
they judge to be unlawful, and which they
command us so to account of, then we ought
to obey God rather than men; but if they
enjoin such things as they judge to be indifferent,
and which they command us so to
account of, then we ought to obey their ordinance.
Which distinction, methinks, would
have made Heraclitus himself to fall a
laughing with Democritus. What then remaineth?
Surely our opposites must either
say nothing, or else say with us, that it is not
only a liberty but a duty of inferiors, not to
receive for a thing lawful that which is enjoined
by superiors, because they account it and
call it such, but by the judgment of their
own discretion following the rules of the
word, to try and examine whether the same
be lawful or unlawful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span>. 18. These <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">praecognita</span></span> being now
made good, come we to speak more particularly
of the power of princes to make laws
and ordinances about things which concern
the worship of God. The purpose we will
unfold in three distinctions: 1. Of things;
2. Of times; 3. Of ties. First, Let us distinguish
two sorts of things in the worship
of God, viz., things substantial, and things
circumstantial. To things substantial we
refer as well sacred and significant ceremonies
as the more necessary and essential
parts of worship, and, in a word, all things
which are not mere external circumstances,
such as were not particularly determinable
within those bounds which it pleased God
to set to his written word, and the right
ordering whereof, as it is common to all
human societies, whether civil or sacred, so
it is investigable by the very light and guidance
of natural reason. That among this
kind of mere circumstances sacred significant
ceremonies cannot be reckoned, we
have otherwhere made it evident. Now,
therefore, of things pertaining to the substance
of God's worship, whether they be
sacred ceremonies, or greater and more necessary
duties, we say that princes have not
power to enjoin anything of this kind which
hath not the plain and particular institution
of God himself in Scripture. They may indeed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-294">[pg 1-294]</span><a name="Pg1-294" id="Pg1-294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and ought to publish God's own ordinances
and commandments, and, by their
coactive temporal power, urge and enforce
the observation of the same. Notwithstanding,
it is a prince's duty, <span class="tei tei-q">“that in the worship
of God, whether internal or external,
he move nothing, he prescribe nothing, except
that which is expressly delivered in
God's own written word.”</span><a id="noteref_947" name="noteref_947" href="#note_947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">947</span></span></a> We must beware
we confound not things which have
the plain warrant of God's word with
things devised by the will of man. David,
Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah, and other
kings among the people of God, did, as well
laudably as lawfully, enjoin and command
that worship and form of religion which
God, in his law and by his prophets, commanded;
and forbid, avoid, and abolish
such corruptions as God had forbidden before
them, and appointed to be abolished;
whence it followeth not that kings may
enjoin things which want the warrant of
the word, but only this much, which all
of us commend, viz., <span class="tei tei-q">“That a Christian
prince's office in religion,<a id="noteref_948" name="noteref_948" href="#note_948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a> is diligently to
take care that, in his dominion or kingdom,
religion out of the pure word of God, expounded
by the word of God itself, and
understood according to the first principles
of faith (which others call the analogy of
faith), either be instituted, or, being instituted,
be kept pure, or, being corrupted,
be restored and reformed, that false doctrines,
abuses, idols, and superstitions, be
taken away, to the glory of God, and to his
own and his subjects' salvation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 19. But in all the Scripture princes
have neither a commendable example, nor
any other warrant, for the making of any
innovation in religion, or for the prescribing
of sacred significant ceremonies of men's
devising. Jeroboam caused a change to be
made in the ceremonies and form of God's
worship, whereas God ordained the ark of
the covenant to be the sign of his presence,
and that his glory should dwell between the
cherubims. Jeroboam set up two calves to
be the signs representative of that God
who brought <span class="tei tei-q">“Israel out of Egypt;”</span> and
this he means while he saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold thy
gods,”</span> &amp;c., 1 Kings xii. 28, giving to the
signs the thing signified; whereas God ordained
Jerusalem to be the place of worship,
and all the sacrifices to be brought to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-295">[pg 1-295]</span><a name="Pg1-295" id="Pg1-295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the temple of Solomon, Jeroboam made
Dan and Bethel to be places of worship, and
built there altars and high places for the
sacrifices; whereas God ordained the sons of
Aaron only to be his priests, Jeroboam
made priests of the lowest of the people,
which were not of the sons of Levi; whereas
God ordained the feast of tabernacles to
be kept on the fifteenth day of the seventh
month, Jeroboam appointed it on the fifteenth
day of the eighth month. Now, if
any prince in the world might have fair
pretences for the making of such innovations
in religion, Jeroboam much more. He
might allege for his changing of the signs
of God's presence, and of the place of worship,
that since Rehoboam's wrath was incensed
against him, and against the ten
tribes which adhered unto him (as appeareth
by the accounting of them to be rebels,
2 Chron. xiii. 6, and by the gathering of
a huge army for bringing the kingdom
again to Rehoboam, 2 Chron. xi. 1), it was
no longer safe for his subjects to go up to
Jerusalem to worship, in which case God,
who required mercy more than sacrifice,
would bear with their changing of a few
ceremonies for the safety of men's lives.
For his putting down of the priests and
Levites, and his ordaining of other priests
which were not of the sons of Levi, he
might pretend that they were rebellious to
him, in that they would not assent unto his
new ordinances,<a id="noteref_949" name="noteref_949" href="#note_949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> which he had enacted for
the safety and security of his subjects, and
that they did not only simply refuse obedience
to these his ordinances, but in their
refusal show themselves so stedfastly minded,
that they would refuse and withstand
even to the suffering of deprivation and deposition;
and not only so, but likewise drew
after them many others of the rest of the
tribes to be of their judgment, 2 Chron. xi.
16, and to adhere to that manner of worship
which was retained in Jerusalem. Lastly,
For the change which he made about the
season of the feast of tabernacles, he might
have this pretence, that as it was expedient
for the strengthening of his kingdom<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href="#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a> to
draw and allure as many as could be had to
associate and join themselves with him in his
form of worship (which could not be done if
he should keep that feast at the same time
when it was kept at Jerusalem); so there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-296">[pg 1-296]</span><a name="Pg1-296" id="Pg1-296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was no less (if not more) order and decency in
keeping it in the eighth month, when the
fruits of the ground were perfectly gathered
in<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href="#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> (for thankful remembrance whereof that
feast was celebrated) than in the seventh,
when they were not so fully collected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These pretences he might have made yet
more plausible, by professing and avouching
that he intended to worship no idols, but
the Lord only; that he had not fallen from
anything which was fundamental and essential
in divine faith and religion, that the
changes which he had made were only about
some alterable ceremonies which were not
essential to the worship of God, and that
even in these ceremonies he had not made
any change for his own will and pleasure,
but for important reasons which concerned
the good of his kingdom and safety of his
subjects. Notwithstanding of all this, the
innovations which he made about these ceremonies
of sacred signs, sacred places, sacred
persons, sacred times, are condemned for
this very reason, because he devised them of
his own heart, 1 Kings xii. 33, which was
enough to convince him of horrible impiety
in making Israel to sin. Moreover, when
king Ahaz took a pattern of the altar of
Damascus, and sent it to Urijah the priest,
though we cannot gather from the text that
he either intended or pretended any other
respect beside the honouring and pleasuring
of his patron and protector, the king of Assyria,
2 Kings xvi. 10, 18 (for of his appointing
that new altar for his own and all
the people's sacrifices, there was nothing
heard till after his return from Damascus, at
which time he began to fall back from one
degree of defection to a greater), yet this
very innovation of taking the pattern of an
altar from idolaters is marked as a sin and a
snare. Last of all, whereas many of the
kings of Judah and Israel did either themselves
worship in the groves and the high
places, or else, at least, suffer the people to
do so, howsoever they might have alleged<a id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952" href="#note_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a>
specious reasons for excusing themselves,—as
namely, that they gave not this honour
to any strange gods, but to the Lord only;
that they chose these places only to worship
in wherein God was of old seen and
worshipped by the patriarchs, that the
groves and the high places added a most
amiable splendour and beauty to the worship
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-297">[pg 1-297]</span><a name="Pg1-297" id="Pg1-297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of God, and that they did consecrate
these places for divine worship in a good
meaning, and with minds wholly devoted
to God's honour,—yet notwithstanding, because
this thing was not commanded of God,
neither came it into his heart, he would admit
no excuses, but ever challengeth it as a
grievous fault in the government of those
kings, that those high places were not taken
away, and that the people still sacrificed in
the high places; from all which examples
we learn how highly God was and is displeased
with men for adding any other sacred
ceremonies to those which he himself hath
appointed.<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 20. Now as touching the other sort
of things which we consider in the worship
of God, namely, things merely circumstantial,
and such as have the very same use and
respect in civil which they have in sacred actions,
we hold that whensoever it happeneth
to be the duty and part of a prince to institute
and enjoin any order or policy in
these circumstances of God's worship, then
he may only enjoin such an order as may
stand with the observing and following of
the rules of the word, whereunto we are tied
in the use and practice of things which are
in their general nature indifferent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of these rules I am to speak in the
fourth part of the dispute. And here I say
no more but this: Since the word commandeth
us to do all things to the glory of God,
1 Cor. x. 31; to do all things to edifying,
1 Cor. xiv. 29; and to do all things in
faith, and full persuasion of the lawfulness
of that which we do, Rom. xiv. 5, 23,
therefore there is no prince in the world
who hath power to command his subjects to
do that which should either dishonour God,
or not honour him; or that which should
either offend their brother, or not edify
him; or, lastly, that which their conscience
either condemneth or doubteth of. For how
may a prince command that which his subjects
may not do? But a wonder it were if
any man should so far refuse to be ashamed
that he would dare to say we are not bound
to order whatsoever we do according to
these rules of the word, but only such matters
of private action wherein we are left
at full liberty, there being no ordinance of
superiors to determine our practice, and that
if such an ordinance be published and propounded
unto us, we should take it alone
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-298">[pg 1-298]</span><a name="Pg1-298" id="Pg1-298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for our rule, and no longer think to examine
and order our practice by the rules of the
word;
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. This were as much as to say, that
in the circumstances of God's worship we
are bound to take heed unto God's rules,
then only and in that case when men give
us none of their rules, which, if they do,
God's rules must give place to men's rules,
and not theirs to his.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. If it were so, then we should never
make reckoning to God, whether that
which we had done in obedience to superiors
was right or wrong, good or bad, and
we should only make reckoning of such
things done by us as were not determined
by a human law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The law of superiors is never the supreme
but ever a subordinate rule, and (as
we said before) it can never be a rule to us,
except in so far only as it is ruled by a
higher rule. Therefore we have ever another
rule to take heed unto beside their
law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The Scripture speaketh most generally,
and admitteth no exception from the
rules which it giveth: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatsoever ye do
(though commanded by superiors) do all to
the glory of God. Let all things (though
commanded by superiors) be done to edifying.
Whatsoever is not of faith (though
commanded by superiors) is sin.”</span>
</p>

5. We may do nothing for the sole will
and pleasure of men, for this were to be the
servants of men, as hath been shown. The

considered,<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a> he had not so absolutely pronounced
that the power of the kings may
make constitutions of the places and times,
when and where the exercises of piety may
be conveniently had, also with what order,
what rite, what gesture, what habit, the
mysteries shall be more decently celebrated.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-299">[pg 1-299]</span><a name="Pg1-299" id="Pg1-299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But what! thought he this power of kings
is not astricted to the rules of the word?
Have they any power which is to destruction
and not to edification? Can they command
their subjects to do anything in the circumstances
of divine worship which is not for
the glory of God, which is not profitable for
edifying, and which they cannot do in faith?
Nay, that all the princes in the world have
not such power as this, will easily appear to
him who attendeth unto the reasons which
we have propounded. And because men do
easily and ordinarily pretend that their constitutions
are according to the rules of the
word, when they are indeed repugnant to
the same, therefore we have also proved
that inferiors may and must try and examine
every ordinance of their superiors,
and that by the judgment of private discretion,
following the rules of the word. I
say following the rules of the word, because
we will never allow a man to follow Anabaptistical
or Swenckfeldian-like enthusiasms
and inspirations.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 22. Touching the application of
what hath been said unto the controverted
ceremonies, there needs nothing now to be
added. For that they belong not to that
sort of things which may be applied to civil
uses, with the same respect and account
which they have being applied to religious
uses, the account I mean of mere circumstances
serving only for that common order
and decency which is and should be observed
in civil no less than in sacred actions,
but that they belong to the substance
of worship, as being sacred significant ceremonies,
wherein both holiness and necessity
are placed, and which may not without his
sacrilege be used out of the compass of
worship, we have elsewhere plainly evinced.
And this kind of things, whensover they are
men's devices, and not God's ordinances,
cannot be lawfully enjoined by princes, as
hath been showed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if any man will needs have these ceremonies
in question to go under the name
of mere circumstances, let us put the case
they were no other, yet our conforming unto
them, which is urged, cannot stand with
the rules of the word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It could not be for the glory of God, not
only for that it is offensive to many of Christ's
little ones, but likewise for that it ministereth
occasion to the enemies of the Lord to
blaspheme; to atheists, because by these
naughty observances they see the commandments
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-300">[pg 1-300]</span><a name="Pg1-300" id="Pg1-300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of God made of little or no effect, and
many godly both persons and purposes despised
and depressed, whereat they laugh in
their sleeve and say, Aha! so would we have
it; to Papists, because as by this our conformity
they confirm themselves in sundry
of their errors and superstitions, so perceiving
us so little to abhor the pomp and
bravery of their mother of harlots, that we
care not to borrow from her some of her
meretricious trinkets, they promise to themselves
that in the end we shall take as great
a draught of the cup of the wine of her fornications
as they themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neither yet can our conforming unto the
ceremonies pressed upon us be profitable
for edifying, for we have given sufficient
demonstration of manifold hurts and inconveniences
ensuing thereon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor, lastly, can we conform to them in
faith; for as our consciences cannot find, so
the word cannot afford, any warrant for
them. Of all which things now I only
make mention, because I have spoken of
them enough otherwhere.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 23. The second distinction which
may help our light in this question about
the power of princes, is of times; for when
the church and ministers thereof are corrupted
and must be reformed, princes may
do much more in making laws about things
ecclesiastical than regularly they may, when
ecclesiastical persons are both able and willing
to do their duty, in rightly taking care
of all things which ought to be provided for
the good of the church, and conservation or
purgation of religion. <span class="tei tei-q">“For (saith Junuis<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href="#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a>)
both the church, when the joining of the
magistrate faileth, may extraordinarily do
something which ordinarily she cannot; and
again, when the church faileth of her duty,
the magistrate may extraordinarily procure
that the church return to her duty; that is,
in such a case extraordinarily happening,
these (ecclesiastical persons) and those (magistrates)
may extraordinarily do something
which ordinarily they cannot. For this belongeth
to common law and equity, that unto
extraordinary evils, extraordinary remedies
must also be applied.”</span> We acknowledge
that it belongeth to princes<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href="#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“to reform
things in the church, as often as the ecclesiastical
persons shall, either through ignorance,
disorder of the affection of covetousness,

or ambition, defile the Lord's sanctuary.”</span>
At such extraordinary times, princes,
by their coactive temporal power, ought
to procure and cause a reformation of abuses,
and the avoiding of misorders in the church,
though with the discontent of the clergy,
for which end and purpose they may not
only enjoin and command the profession of
that faith, and the practice of that religion
which God's word appointeth, but also prescribe
such an order and policy in the circumstances
of divine worship as they in
their judgment of Christian discretion, observing
and following the rules of the word,
shall judge and try to be convenient for the
present time and case, and all this under the
commination of such temporal losses, pains,
or punishments as they shall deprehend to
be reasonable. But at other ordinary times,
when ecclesiastical persons are neither
through ignorance unable, nor through
malice and perverseness of affection unwilling,
to put order to whatsoever requireth
any mutation to be made in the church and
service of God, in that case, without their
advice and consent, princes may not make
an innovation of any ecclesiastical rite, nor
publish any ecclesiastical law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 24. When Dr Field<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href="#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a> speaketh of
the power of princes to prescribe and make
laws about things spiritual or ecclesiastical,
he saith, That the prince may, with the advice
and direction of his clergy, command
things pertaining to God's worship and service,
both for profession of faith, ministration
of the sacraments, and conversation
fitting to Christians in general, or men of
ecclesiastical order in particular, under the
pains of death, imprisonment, banishment,
confiscation of goods, and the like; and by his
princely power establish things formerly defined
and decreed, against whatsoever error
and contrary ill custom and observation. In
all this the Doctor saith very right; but I
demand, further, these two things: 1. What
if the thing have not been decreed before?
and what if the free assent of the clergy be
not had for it? Would the Doctor have said
that in such a case the prince hath not
power by himself, and by his own sole
authority, to enjoin it, and to establish a
law concerning it? For example, that
king James had not power by himself to
impose the controverted ceremonies upon
the church of Scotland at that time when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-302">[pg 1-302]</span><a name="Pg1-302" id="Pg1-302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as no free assent (much less the direction)
of the clergy was had for them, so neither
had they been formerly decreed, but laws
and decrees were formerly made against
them. If the Doctor would have answered
affirmatively that he had this power, then
why did he, in a scornful dissimulation, so
circumscribe and limit the power of princes,
by requiring a former decree, and the free
assent of the clergy? If he would have
answered negatively, that he had no such
power, we should have rendered him thanks
for his answer. 2. Whether may the clergy
make any laws about things pertaining to
the service of God which the prince may
not as well by himself, and without them,
constitute and authorise? If the affirmative
part be granted unto us, we gladly take it.
But we suppose Dr Field did, and our opposites
yet do, hold the negative. Whereupon
it followeth that the prince hath as
much, yea, the very same power, of making
laws in all ecclesiastical things which the
clergy themselves have when they are convened
in a lawful and free assembly, yet I
guess from the Doctor's words that he would
have replied, namely, that the difference is
great betwixt the power of making laws
about things ecclesiastical in the prince, and
the same power in the clergy assembled together;
for he describeth the making of a
law to be the prescribing of something, under
some pain or punishment, which he that
so prescribeth hath power to inflict. Whereby
he would make it appear that he yieldeth
not unto princes the same power of spiritual
jurisdiction, in making of ecclesiastical
laws, which agreeth to the clergy; because,
whereas a council of the clergy may frame
canons about things which concern the worship
of God, and prescribe them under the
pain of excommunication, and other ecclesiastical
censures, the ordinance of princes
about such matters is only under the pain
of some external or bodily punishment. But
I answer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">potestas</span></span> διατακτικὴ is one thing,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">potestas</span></span> κειτικὴ is another thing. When
the making of a law is joined either with
the intention, or with the commination of a
punishment, in case of transgression, this is
but accidental and adventitious to the law,
not naturally nor necessarily belonging to
the essence of the same; for many laws
there hath been, and may be, which prescribe
not that which they contain under
the same pain or punishment. Gratian distinguisheth
three sorts of laws: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Omnis</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-303">[pg 1-303]</span><a name="Pg1-303" id="Pg1-303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
&amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“Every law (saith he<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a>) either permits
something; for example, let a valorous man
seek a reward: or forbids; for example, let
it be lawful to no man to seek the marriage
of holy virgins: or punisheth; for example,
he who committeth murder let him be capitally
punished.”</span> And in this third kind
only there is something prescribed under a
pain or punishment. It is likewise holden
by schoolmen,<a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a> that it is a law which permitteth
something indifferent, as well as it
which commandeth some virtue, or forbiddeth
some vice. When a prince doth statute
and ordain, that whosoever, out of a generous
and magnanimous spirit, will adventure
to embark and hazard in a certain
military exploit against a foreign enemy,
whom he intendeth to subdue, shall be allowed
to take for himself in propriety all
the rich spoil which he can lay hold on,—there
is nothing here prescribed under some
pain or punishment, yet it is a law, and
properly so termed. And might not the
name of a law be given unto that edict of
King Darius, whereby he decreed that all
they in his dominions should fear the God
of Daniel, forasmuch as he is the living and
eternal God, who reigneth for ever, Dan. vi.;
yet it prescribed nothing under some pain
or punishment to be inflicted by him who
so prescribed. Wherefore, though the prince
publisheth ecclesiastical laws under other
pains and punishments than the clergy doth,
this showeth only that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">potestas</span></span> κειτικὴ is
not the same, but different, in the one and
in the other; yet if it be granted that whatsoever
ecclesiastical law a synod of the clergy
hath power to make and publish, the prince
hath power to make and publish without
them, by his own sole authority, it followeth,
that the power of the church to make
laws which is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">potestas</span></span> διατακτικὴ,
doth agree as much, as properly, and as
directly to the prince, as to a whole synod
of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 25. Now, therefore, we firmly hold,
1. That the prince may not innovate any
custom or rite of the church, nor publish
any ecclesiastical law, without the free assent
of the clergy, they being neither unable for,
nor unwilling unto, their ecclesiastical functions
and duties; yea, further, that so far as
is possible, the consent of the whole church
ought to be had whensoever any change is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-304">[pg 1-304]</span><a name="Pg1-304" id="Pg1-304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to be made of some order or custom in the
church; for that which toucheth the whole
church, and is to be used by the whole church,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ab omnibus etiam merito curatur</span></span>.<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a> Therefore,
when there is any change to be made
in the rites of the church, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">merito fit hoc
cum omnium ordinum ecclesiae consensu</span></span>.<a id="noteref_963" name="noteref_963" href="#note_963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">963</span></span></a>
Neither was there ever a rightly reformed
church which was helped and not hurt by
such rites and customs as, to their grief and
miscontentment, princes did impose upon
them. Whence it was, that <span class="tei tei-q">“they who
were orthodox did ever withstand such a
magistrate as would have, by his commandments,
tied the church to that which was
burdensome to their consciences.”</span><a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href="#note_964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a> That
such inconveniences may be shunned, it is
fit, that, when any change is to be made in
the policy of a church, not the clergy
alone, but the elders also, and men of understanding
among the laity, in a lawful
assembly, freely give their voices and consent
thereunto. Good reason have our
writers to hold against Papists, that laymen
ought to have place in councils wherein
things which concern the whole church are
to be deliberated upon. 2. Lest it be
thought enough that princes devise, frame,
and establish, ecclesiastical laws as them
best liketh, and then, for more show of
orderly proceeding, some secret and sinistrous
way extort and procure the assent of
the synod of the church; therefore we add,
that it belongeth to the synod (the clergy
having the chief place therein, to give direction
and advice), not to receive and approve
the definition of the prince in things
which concern the worship of God, but itself
to define and determine what orders
and customs are fittest to be observed in
such things, that thereafter the prince may
approve and ratify the same, and press

unto religion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dirigere atque disponere
penes magistratum est proprie, penes ecclesiasticos

and disposing of such things doth then
only belong to ecclesiastical persons when
the church suffereth persecution, or when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-305">[pg 1-305]</span><a name="Pg1-305" id="Pg1-305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the magistrate permitteth that the matter

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our writers have said much of the power
of the church to make laws, but this man (I
perceive) will correct them all, and will not
acknowledge that the church hath any power
of making laws about things pertaining to
religion (except by accident, because of persecution
or permission), but only a power of
executing what princes please to direct.
More fully to deliver our mind, we say,
that in the making of laws about things
which concern the worship of God, the
prince may do much <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per actus imperatos</span></span>,
but nothing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per actus elicitos</span></span>. For the
more full explanation of which distinction,
I liken the prince to the will of man; the
ministers of the church to man's particular
senses; a synod of the church to that internal
sense which is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus communis</span></span>;
the fountain and original of all the external
things and actions ecclesiastical, or
such as concern the worship of God, to the
objects and actions of the particular senses;
and the power of making ecclesiastical laws
to that power and virtue of the common sense,
whereby it perceiveth, discerneth, and judgeth
of the objects and actions of all the particular
senses. Now as the will commandeth
the common sense to discern and judge of
the actions and objects of all the particular
senses, thereafter commandeth the eye to
see, and the ear to hear, the nose to smell,
&amp;c., yet it hath not power by itself to exercise
or bring forth any of these actions,
for the will can neither see nor yet judge of
the object and action of sight, &amp;c. So the
prince may command a synod of the church
to judge of ecclesiastical things and actions,
and to define what order and form of policy
is most convenient to be observed in things
pertaining to divine worship, and thereafter
he may command the particular ministers of
the church to exercise the works of their
ministry, and to apply themselves unto that
form of church regiment and policy which
the synod hath prescribed, yet he may not
by himself define and direct such matters,
nor make any laws thereanent.

we call both those which God commandeth
for the sanctification of our mind

those which the decency and order of the
church requireth to be ordained and observed
for the profitable and convenient use of
the things which are necessary; for example,
prayers, the administration of the word

things necessary, and essentially belonging
to the communion of saints; but set days,
set hours, set places, fasts, and if there be
any such like, they belong to the decency
and order of the church, without which the
church cannot be well edified, nor any particular

things we call such duties as touch the life,

ministers, saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Obey them that have the

gather, that in things pertaining to God, and
which touch the spiritual benefit of the soul,
the ministers of the church ought to give
direction, and to be obeyed, as those who, in
things of this nature, have the rule over all
others of the church (and by consequence
over princes also), so that it be in the Lord.
And lest this place and power which is given
to ministers, should either be abused by
themselves to the commanding of what they
will, or envied by others, as too great honour
and pre-eminence, the Apostle showeth
what a painful charge lieth on them, and
what a great reckoning they have to make.
They watch for your souls, saith he, not only
by preaching and warning every one, and
by offering up their earnest prayers to God
for you, but likewise by taking such care of
ecclesiastical discipline, order, and policy, that
they must provide and procure whatsoever
shall be expedient for your spiritual good,

manner you are to perform the
works of God's worship, as also to avoid and
shun every scandal and inconveniency which
may hinder your spiritual good. And of
these things, whether they have done them
or not, they must make account before the
judgment seat of the great Bishop of your
souls. Surely, if it belong to princes to do
fine and ordain what order and policy should
be observed in the church, what forms and
fashions should be used, for the orderly and

observeth of king Joash,<a id="noteref_975" name="noteref_975" href="#note_975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">975</span></span></a> that he did

of the temple, nor define what was to be
done unto every breach therein, but committed
this matter to be directed and cared
for by the priests, whom it chiefly concerned,
commanding them to take course for the
reparation of the breaches of the house,
wheresoever any breach should be found,
and allowing them money for the work.
Whereupon he further noteth, that as the
superior part of man's soul doth not itself
hear, see, touch, walk, speak, but commandeth
the ears, eyes, hands, feet, and tongue,
to do the same; so the magistrate should
not himself either teach or make laws, but
command that these things be done by the
doctors and teachers. Cartwright and Pareus
upon Heb. xiii. 17, tell the Papists,
that we acknowledge princes are holden to
be obedient unto pastors in things that belong
unto God, if they rule according to the
word, which could not be so, if the making
of laws about things pertaining to God and
his worship did not of right and due belong
unto pastors, but unto princes themselves.
Our Second Book of Discipline, chap. 12,
ordaineth, <span class="tei tei-q">“That ecclesiastical assemblies
have their place, with power to the kirk to
appoint times and places convenient for the
same, and all men, as well magistrates as
inferiors, to be subject to the judgment of
the same in ecclesiastical causes.”</span> Balduine
holdeth,<a id="noteref_976" name="noteref_976" href="#note_976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">976</span></span></a>
that a prince may not by himself
enjoin any new ecclesiastical rite, but must
convocate a synod for the deliberation and
definition of such things. And what mean
our writers when they say,<a id="noteref_977" name="noteref_977" href="#note_977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">977</span></span></a> that kings have
no spiritual but only a civil power in the
church? As actions are decerned by the
objects, so are powers by the actions: if,
therefore, kings do commendably by themselves
make laws about things pertaining to
God's worship, which is a spiritual action,
then have they also a spiritual power in the
church; but if they have no spiritual power,
that is, no power of spiritual jurisdiction,
how can they actually exercise spiritual jurisdiction?
That the making of laws about
things pertaining to God's worship is an action
of spiritual jurisdiction, it needeth no
great demonstration; for, 1. When a synod
of the church maketh laws about such things,
all men know that this is an action of spiritual
jurisdiction flowing from that power of
spiritual jurisdiction which is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">potestas</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-311">[pg 1-311]</span><a name="Pg1-311" id="Pg1-311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
διατακτικὴ. And how then can the prince's
making of such laws be called an action of
civil, not of spiritual jurisdiction? I see
not what can be answered, except it be
said, that the making of those laws by a
synod is an action of spiritual jurisdiction,
because they are made and published with
the commination of spiritual and ecclesiastical
punishments in case of transgression,
but the making of them by the prince is an
action of jurisdiction only, because he prescribeth
and commandeth, under the pain of
some temporal loss or punishment. But I
have already confuted this answer, because
notwithstanding of the different punishments
which the one and the other hath power to
threaten and inflict, yet, at least, that part of
spiritual jurisdiction which we call <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">potestas</span></span>
διατακτικὴ remaineth the same in both,
which power of making laws must not (as
I show) be confounded with that other power
of judging and punishing offenders. 2. Actions
take their species or kind from the object
and the end, when other circumstances
hinder not. Now, a prince's making of laws
about things pertaining to religion, is such
an action of jurisdiction, as hath both a spiritual
end, which is the edification of the
church and spiritual good of Christians, and
likewise a spiritual object; for that all things
pertaining to divine worship, even the very
external circumstances of the same, are rightly
called things spiritual and divine, not civil
or human, our opposites cannot deny,
except they say, not only that such things
touch the lives, bodies, estates, or names of
men, and are not ordained for the spiritual
benefit of their souls, but also that the synod
of the church, whose power reacheth
only to things spiritual, not civil or human,
can never make laws about those circumstances
which are applied unto, and used in
the worship of God; and as the prince's
making of laws about things of this nature,
is in respect of the object and end, an action
of spiritual jurisdiction, so there is no circumstance
at all which varieth the kind, or
maketh it an action of civil jurisdiction only.
If it be said, that the circumstance of the
person changeth the kind of the action, so
that the making of laws about things pertaining
to religion, if they be made by ecclesiastical
persons, is an action of spiritual jurisdiction;
but if, by the civil magistrate,
an action of civil jurisdiction, this were a
most extremely unadvised distinction; for
so might Uzziah the king have answered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-312">[pg 1-312]</span><a name="Pg1-312" id="Pg1-312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for himself, 2 Chron. xxvi. 18, that, in
burning incense, he did not take upon him
to execute the priest's office, because he was
only a civil person; so may the Pope say,
that he might not take upon him the power
of emperors and monarchs, because he is an
ecclesiastical person. Many things men do
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span>, which they cannot <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de jure</span></span>.
Civil persons may exercise a spiritual jurisdiction
and office, and, again, ecclesiastical persons
may exercise a civil jurisdiction <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
facto</span></span>, though not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de jure</span></span>. Wherefore the
prince's making of laws about things spiritual
remaineth still an action of spiritual
jurisdiction, except some other thing can be
alleged to the contrary, beside the circumstance
of the person. But some man, peradventure,
will object that a prince, by his
civil power, may enjoin and command not
only the observation of those ecclesiastical
rites which a synod of the church prescribeth,
but also that a synod (when need is)
prescribe new orders and rites, all which
are things spiritual and divine. And why
then may he not, by the same civil power,
make laws about the rites and circumstances
of God's worship, notwithstanding that they
are (in their use and application to the actions
of worship) things spiritual, not civil.

unto the ceremonies in question can be no
way warranted by any ordinance of the supreme
magistrate, or any power which he
hath in things spiritual or ecclesiastical;
and if our opposites would ponder the reasons
we have given, they should be quickly
quieted, understanding that, before the
prince's ordinance about the ceremonies can
be said to bind us, it must first be showed
that they have been lawfully prescribed by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-314">[pg 1-314]</span><a name="Pg1-314" id="Pg1-314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a synod of the church, so that they must retire
and hold them as the church's ordinance.
And what needeth any more? Let
us once see any lawful ordinance of the synod
or church representative for them, we
shall, without any more ado, acknowledge it
to be out of all doubt that his Majesty may
well urge conformity unto the same.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, of the church's power we have
spoken in the former chapter; and if we
had not, yet that which hath been said in
this chapter maketh out our point. For it
hath been proved, that neither king nor
church hath power to command anything
which is not according to the rules of the
word; that is, which serveth not for the
glory of God, which is not profitable for
edifying, and which may not be done in
faith; unto which rules, whether the things
which are commanded us be agreeable or
not, we must try and examine by the private
judgment of Christian discretion, following
the light of God's word.

when the law bindeth the conscience simply,
so that, in no respect, nor in no case, without
the offence of God and wound of conscience,
one may depart from the prescript
thereof; but another bond is hypothetical,
when it bindeth not simply, but under a
condition, to wit, if the transgression of the
law be done of contempt,—if for the cause of
lucre or some other vicious end,—if it have
scandal joined with it.”</span> The former way,
he saith that the law of God and nature
bindeth, and that the law of the civil magistrate
bindeth the latter way; and with
him we hold that whatsoever a prince commandeth
his subjects in things any way pertaining
to religion, it bindeth only this latter
way, and that he hath never power to
make laws binding the former way, for confirmation
wherefore we say,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The laws of an ecclesiastical synod, to
the obedience whereof, in things belonging
to the worship of God, we are far more
strictly tied than to the obedience of any
prince in the world, who (as hath been
showed) in this sort of things hath not such
a vocation nor power to make laws. The
laws, I say, of a synod cannot bind absolutely,
but only conditionally, or in case
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-315">[pg 1-315]</span><a name="Pg1-315" id="Pg1-315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they cannot be transgressed without violating
the law of charity, by contempt showed
or scandal given, which, as I have made
good in the first part of this dispute, so let
me now produce for it a plain testimony of
the Bishop of Salisbury,<a id="noteref_983" name="noteref_983" href="#note_983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">983</span></span></a> who holdeth that
the church's rites and ordinance do only
bind in such sort, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ut si extra</span></span>, &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-q">“That
if, out of the case of scandal or contempt,
through imprudence, oblivion, or some reasonable
cause enforcing, they be omitted, no
mortal sin is incurred before God; for as
touching these constitutions, I judge the opinion
of Gerson to be most true, to wit, that
they remain inviolated so long as the law of
charity is not by men violated about the
same.”</span> Much less, then, can the laws of
princes about things spiritual or ecclesiastical
bind absolutely, and out of the case of
violating the law of charity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. If we be not bound to receive and acknowledge
the laws of princes as good and
equitable, except only in so far as they are
warranted by the law of God and nature,
then we are not bound in conscience to obey
them, except only conditionally, in case the
violating of them include the violating of the
law of God and nature; but the former is
true, therefore the latter. It is God's peculiar
sovereignty, that his will is a rule ruling,
but not ruled, and that therefore a
thing is good because God will have it to
be good. Man's will is only such a rule as
is ruled by higher rules, and it must be
known to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">norma recta</span></span> before it can be
to us <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">norma recti</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. If we be bound to try and examine,
by the judgment of discretion (following the
rules of the word), whether the things which
princes command be right, and such as ought
to be done; and if we find them not to be
such, to neglect them, then their laws cannot
bind absolutely and by themselves, (else
what need were there of such trial and examination?)
but only conditionally, and in
case they cannot be neglected without violating
some other law, which is of a superior
bond. But the former we have proved by
strong reasons, therefore the latter standeth
sure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. If neither princes may command, nor
we do anything which is not lawful and expedient,
and according to the other rules of
the word, then the laws of princes bind not
absolutely, but only in case the neglecting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-316">[pg 1-316]</span><a name="Pg1-316" id="Pg1-316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of them cannot stand with the law of charity
and the rules of the word; but the former
hath been evinced and made good,
therefore the latter necessarily followeth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. If the laws of princes could bind absolutely
and simply, so that in no case, without
offending God and wounding our conscience,
we could neglect them, this bond
should arise either from their own authority,
or from the matter and thing itself which is
commanded, but from neither of these it
can arise, therefore from nothing. It cannot
arise from any authority which they
have, for if, by their authority, we mean
their princely pre-eminence and dignity, they
are princes when they command things unlawful
as well as when they command things
lawful, and so if, because of their pre-eminence
their laws do bind, then their unlawful
ordinances do bind no less than if
they were lawful; but if by their authority
we mean the power which they have of God
to make laws, this power is not absolute (as
hath been said) but limited; therefore from
it no absolute bond can arise, but this much
at the most, that <span class="tei tei-q">“kings on earth must be
obeyed,<a id="noteref_984" name="noteref_984" href="#note_984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">984</span></span></a>
so far as they command in Christ.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neither yet can the bond be absolute in
respect of the thing itself which is commanded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When princes publish the commandments
of God, the things themselves bind whether
they should command them or not, but we
speak of such things as God's word hath left
in their nature indifferent, and of such
things we say, that if being enjoined by
princes they did absolutely bind, then they
should be in themselves immutably necessary,
even secluding as well the laws of
princes which enjoin them, as the end of
order, decency, and edification, whereunto
they are referred. To say no more, hath
not Dr Forbesse told us in Calvin's words,<a id="noteref_985" name="noteref_985" href="#note_985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">985</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notatu dignum</span></span>, &amp;c.?
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is worthy of observation,
that human laws, whether they be
made by the magistrate or by the church,
howsoever they be necessary to be observed
(I speak of such as are good and just), yet
they do not, therefore, by themselves bind
the conscience, because the whole necessity of
observing them looketh to the general end,
but consisteth not in the things commanded.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Whatsoever bond of conscience is not
confirmed and warranted by the word is,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-317">[pg 1-317]</span><a name="Pg1-317" id="Pg1-317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before God, no bond at all. But the absolute
bond wherewith conscience is bound to
the obedience of the laws of princes is not
confirmed nor warranted by the word;
therefore the proposition no man can deny,
who acknowledged that none can have
power or dominion over our consciences but
God only, the great Lawgiver, who alone can
save and destroy, James iv. 12. Neither
doth any writer, whom I have seen, hold
that princes have any power over men's
consciences, but only that conscience is
bound by the laws of princes, for this respect,
because God, who hath power over
our consciences, hath tied us to their laws.
As to the assumption, he who denyeth it
must give instance to the contrary. If those
words of the Apostle be objected, Rom.
xiii. 5, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye must needs be subject, not only
for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I answer, 1. The Apostle saith not that
we must obey, but that we must be subject, for
conscience' sake; and how oft shall we need
to tell our opposites that subjection is one
thing, and obedience another?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. If he had said that we must obey for
conscience' sake, yet this could not have
been expounded of an absolute bond of conscience,
but only of an hypothetical bond,
in case that which the magistrate commandeth
cannot be omitted without breaking the
law of charity. If it be said again, that we
are not only bidden be subject, but likewise
to obey magistrates, Tit. iii. 1: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> And
who denyeth this? But still I ask, are we
absolutely and always bound to obey magistrates?
Nay, but only when they command
such things as are according to the
rules of the word, so that either they must
be obeyed or the law of charity shall be
broken; in this case, and no other, we are
bidden obey.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 31. Thus have we gained a principal
point, viz., that the laws of princes bind
not absolutely but conditionally, not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propter
se</span></span>, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propter aliud</span></span>. Whereupon it followeth,
that except the breach of those ceremonial
ordinances wherewith we are pressed
include the breach of the law of charity,
which is of a superior bond, we are not holden
to obey them. Now that it is not the
breach, but the obedience of those ordinances
which violateth the law of charity,
we have heretofore made manifest, and
in this place we will add only one general:
Whensoever the laws of princes about
things ecclesiastical do bind the conscience
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-318">[pg 1-318]</span><a name="Pg1-318" id="Pg1-318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conditionally, and because of some other
law of a superior bond, which cannot be observed
if they be transgressed (which is the
only respect for which they bind, when they
bind at all), then the things which they prescribe
belong either to the conservation or
purgation of religion; but the controverted
ceremonies belong to neither of these, therefore
the laws made thereanent bind not,
because of some other law which is of a superior
bond. As to the proposition, will
any man say that princes have any more
power than that which is expressed in the
twenty-fifth article of the Confession of
Faith, ratified in the first parliament of
king James VI., which saith thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Moreover,
to kings, princes, rulers, and magistrates,
we affirm that chiefly and most principally,
the conservation and the purgation
of the religion appertains, so that not only
they are appointed for civil policy, but also
for maintenance of the true religion, and
for suppressing of idolatry and superstition
whatsoever?”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hoc nomine</span></span>,
saith Calvin,<a id="noteref_986" name="noteref_986" href="#note_986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">986</span></span></a>

king James, holden at Edinburgh 1612, in
the ratification of the acts and conclusions
of the General Assembly, kept in Glasgow
1610, did innovate and change some
words of that oath of allegiance which the
General Assembly, in reference to the conference
kept 1751, ordained to be given
to the person provided to any benefice with
cure, in the time of his admission, by the
ordinate. For the form of the oath, set
down by the Act of the Assembly, beginneth
thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“I, A. B., now nominate and
admitted to the kirk of D., utterly testify
and declare in my conscience, that the right
excellent, right high, and mighty prince,
James VI., by the grace of God king of
Scots, is the only lawful supreme governor
of this realm, as well in things temporal as
in the conservation and purgation of religion,”</span>
&amp;c. But the form of the oath set
down by the Act of Parliament beginneth
thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“I, A. B., now nominate and admitted
to the kirk of D., testify and declare in
my conscience, that the right excellent, &amp;c.,
is the only lawful supreme governor of this
realm, as well in matters spiritual and ecclesiastical,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-319">[pg 1-319]</span><a name="Pg1-319" id="Pg1-319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as in things temporal,”</span> &amp;c. Yet
I demand, whether or not do the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matters
spiritual and ecclesiastical</span></em>, of which the
Act of Parliament speaketh, or those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all spiritual
or ecclesiastical things or causes</span></em>, of
which the English oath of supremacy speaketh,
comprehend any other thing than is
comprehended under <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the conservation and
purgation of religion</span></em>, whereof the Act of
Assembly speaketh? If it be answered affirmatively,
it will follow that princes have
power to destruction, and not to edification
only; for whatsoever may edify or profit
the church, pertaineth either to the conservation
or the purgation of religion. If negatively,
then it cannot be denied that the
conservation and purgation of religion do
comprehend all the power which princes
have in things ecclesiastical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 32. Now to the assumption. And
first, that the controverted ceremonies pertain
not to the conservation of religion, but
contrariwise to the hurt and prejudice of the
same, experience hath, alas! made it too
manifest; for O what a doleful decay of religion
have they drawn with them in this
land! Let them who have seen Scotland
in her first glory tell how it was then, and
how it is now. Idle and idol-like bishopping
hath shut too the door of painful and
profitable catechising.<a id="noteref_987" name="noteref_987" href="#note_987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a> The keeping of some
festival days is set up instead of the thankful
commemoration of God's inestimable
benefits, howbeit the festivity of Christmas
hath hitherto served more to bacchanalian
lasciviousness than to the remembrance of
the birth of Christ.<a id="noteref_988" name="noteref_988" href="#note_988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">988</span></span></a> The kneeling down
upon the knees of the body hath now come
in place of that humiliation of the soul
wherewith worthy communicants addressed
themselves unto the holy table of the Lord;
and, generally, the external show of these
fruitless observances hath worn out the very
life and power of religion. Neither have
such effects ensued upon such ceremonies
among us only, but let it be observed everywhere
else, if there be not least substance
and power of godliness among them who
have most ceremonies, whereunto men have,
at their pleasure, given some sacred use and
signification in the worship of God; and
most substance among them who have fewest
shows of external rites. No man of
sound judgment (saith Beza<a id="noteref_989" name="noteref_989" href="#note_989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">989</span></span></a>) will deny,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesum Christum quo nudior</span></span>, &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-q">“that
Jesus Christ, the more naked he be, is made
the more manifest to us; whereas, contrariwise,

indeed, pleadeth for the utility of
ceremonies, as things belonging to the conservation
of religion. His reason is, because
they set before our senses such an external
majesty and splendour, whereby they cause
the more reverence. This he allegeth for
the utility of the ceremonies of the church
of Rome. And I would know what better
reason can be alleged for the utility of ours.
But if this be all, we throw back the argument,
because the external majesty and
splendour of ceremonies doth greatly prejudge
and obscure the spirit and life of the
worship of God, and diverteth the minds of
men from adverting unto the same, which
we have offered to be tried by common experience.
Durand himself, for as much as
he hath written in the defence of ceremonies,
in his unreasonable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rationale</span></span>, yet he
maketh this plain confession:<a id="noteref_992" name="noteref_992" href="#note_992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">992</span></span></a>

which ceremonies carry with them, and how
religion, at its best and first estate, was
without the same!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 33. Neither yet do the ceremonies
in question belong to the purgation of religion;
for wheresoever religion is to be purged
in a corrupted church, all men know that
purgation standeth in putting something
away, not in keeping it still; in voiding
somewhat, nor in retaining it; so that a
church is not purged, but left unpurged,
when the unnecessary monuments of bypast
superstition are still preserved and
kept in the same. And as for the church
of Scotland, least of all could there be any
purgation of it intended by the resuming of
those ceremonies; for such was the most
glorious and ever memorable reformation of
Scotland, that it was far better purged than
any other neighbour church. And of Mr

for, in very deed, as the reformation of Geneva
did pass the reformation of Germany,
so the reformation of Scotland did pass that
of Geneva.

of the power of princes, in making
of laws about things which concern the worship
of God; for this power it is which our
opposites allege for warrant, of the controverted
ceremonies, wherefore to have spoken
of it is sufficient for our present purpose.
Nevertheless, because there are also
other sorts of ecclesiastical things beside the
making of laws, such as the vocation of men
of ecclesiastical order, the convocation and
moderation of councils, the judging and deciding
of controversies about faith, and the
use of the keys, in all which princes have
some place and power of intermeddling, and
a mistaking in one may possibly breed a mistaking
in all; therefore I thought good here
to digress, and of these also to add somewhat,
so far as princes have power and interest in
the same.

Anselmus, Sedulius, Primasius, Theophylactus,
Oecumenius, the Council of Basil,
Arelatensis, J. Parisiensis, Erasmus, Medina,
and Cassander, all which authors have
grounded that which they say upon Scripture;
for beside that Scripture maketh no difference
of order and degree betwixt bishops and
elders, it showeth also that they are one and
the same order. For in Ephesus and Crete,
they who were made elders were likewise
made bishops, Acts xx. 17, 28; Tit. i. 5, 7.
And the Apostle, Phil. i. 1, divideth the
whole ministry in the church of Philippi
into two orders, bishops and deacons. Moreover,
1 Tim. iii., he giveth order only for
bishops and deacons, but saith nothing of a
third order. Wherefore it is manifest, that
beside those two orders of elders and deacons,
there is no other ecclesiastical order
which hath any divine institution, or necessary
use in the church; and princes
should do well to apply their power and authority
to the extirpation and rooting out of
popes, cardinals, patriarchs, primates, archbishops,
bishops, suffragans, abbots, deans,
vice-deans, priors, archdeacons, subdeacons,
abbots, chancellors, chantors, subchantors,
exorcists, monks, eremites, acoloths, and all

the rabble of popish orders, which undo the
church, and work more mischief in the earth
than can be either soon seen or shortly told.

But, contrariwise, princes ought to establish
and maintain in the church, elders and
deacons, according to the apostolical institution.
Now elders are either such as labour
in the word and doctrine, or else such as
are appointed for discipline only. They
who labour in the word and doctrine are
either such as do only teach, and are ordained
for conserving, in schools and seminaries
of learning, the purity of Christian
doctrine, and the true interpretation of
Scripture, and for detecting and confuting
the contrary heresies and errors, whom the
Apostle calleth doctors or teachers; or else
they are such as do not only teach, but also
have a more particular charge to watch over
the flock, to seek that which is lost, to bring
home that which wandereth, to heal that
which is diseased, to bind up that which is
broken, to visit every family, to warn every
person, to rebuke, to comfort, &amp;c., whom
the Apostle called sometimes pastors, and
sometimes bishops or overseers. The other
sort of elders are ordained only for discipline
and church government, and for assisting
of the pastors in ruling the people, overseeing
their manners, and censuring their
faults. That this sort of elders is instituted
by the Apostle, it is put out of doubt, not
alone by Calvin, Beza, and the divines of
Geneva, but also by Chemnitius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exam.</span></span>

eldership is honourable; wherefore the synagogue
also, and afterwards the church, hath
had some elders of the congregation, without
whose council and advice nothing was
done in the church; and that he knew not

use, except it had been by the sluggishness
of the teachers, or rather their pride, whilst
they seemed to themselves to be something,

ought to procure and effect, that there be
never wanting men qualified and fit for
those ecclesiastical functions and charges
which Christ hath ordained, and that such
men only be called, chosen, and set apart
for the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two things contained in this
proposition. 1. That princes ought to procure
that the church never want men qualified
and gifted for the work and service of
the holy ministry, for which end and purpose
they ought to provide and maintain
schools and colleges, entrusted and committed
to the rule and oversight of orthodox,
learned, godly, faithful, and diligent masters,
that so qualified and able men may be
still furnished and sent to take care that the
ministers of the church neither want due
reverence, 1 Tim. v. 17; Heb. xiii. 17, nor
sufficient maintenance, 1 Cor. ix., that so
men be not scarred from the service of the
ministry, but rather encouraged unto the
same, 2 Chron. xxxi. 4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That princes ought also to take order
and course, that well-qualified men, and no
others, be advanced and called to bear
charge and office in the church, for which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-325">[pg 1-325]</span><a name="Pg1-325" id="Pg1-325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purpose they should cause not one disdainful
prelate, but a whole presbytery or company
of elders, to take trial of him who is
to be taken into the number of preaching
elders, and to examine well the piety of his
life, the verity of his doctrine, and his fitness
to teach. And further, that due trial
may be continually had of the growth or
decay of the graces and utterance of every
pastor, it is the part of princes to enjoin the
visitation of particular churches, and the
keeping of other presbyterial meetings, likewise
the assembling of provincial, and national
synods, for putting order to such
things as have not been helped in the particular
presbyteries. And as for the other
sort of elders, together with deacons, we
judge the ancient order of this church to
have been most convenient for providing of
well-qualified men for those functions and
offices; for the eighth head of the First
Book of Discipline, touching the election
of elders and deacons, ordaineth that only
men of best knowledge and cleanest life be
nominate to be in election, and that their
names be publicly read to the whole church
by the minister, giving them advertisement
that from among them must be chosen elders
and deacons, that if any of these nominate
be noted with public infamy, he ought
to be repelled; and that if any man know
others of better qualities within the church
than those that be nominate, they shall be
put in election, that the church may have
the choice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If these courses, whereof we have spoken,
be followed by Christian princes, they shall,
by the blessing of God, procure that the
church shall be served with able and fit ministers;
but though thus they may <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">procurare

not design nor appoint such or such particular
men to the charge of such or such particular
churches, or to the exercise of such or
such ecclesiastical functions, but ought to provide

of the church, as is warranted by the example
of the apostles and primitive church.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The vocation of a minister in the church
is either inward or outward. The inward
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-326">[pg 1-326]</span><a name="Pg1-326" id="Pg1-326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
calling which one must have in finding himself,
by the grace of God, made both able
and willing to serve God and his church
faithfully in the holy ministry, lieth not
open to the view of men, and is only manifest
to him from whom nothing can be hid;
the outward calling is made up of election
and ordination: that signified in Scripture
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cheirotonia</span></span> this by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cheirothesia</span></span> concerning
which things we say with Zanchius,<a id="noteref_1003" name="noteref_1003" href="#note_1003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1003</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magistratus</span></span>,
&amp;c.: <span class="tei tei-q">“It pertaineth to a Christian
magistrate and prince to see for ministers
unto his churches. But how? Not
out of his own arbitrement, but as God's
word teacheth; therefore let the Acts of the
Apostles and the epistles of Paul be read,
how ministers were elected and ordained,
and let them follow that form.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The right of election pertaineth to the
whole church, which as it is maintained by
foreign divines who write of the controversies
with Papists, and as it was the order
which this church prescribed in the Books
of Discipline, so it is commended unto us
by the example of the apostles, and of the
churches planted by them. Joseph and
Matthias were chosen and offered to Christ
by the whole church, being about 120 persons,
Acts i. 15, 23; the apostles required
the whole church and multitude of disciples,
to choose out from among them seven men
to be deacons, Acts vi. 2, 3; the Holy Ghost
said to the whole church at Antioch, being
assembled together to minister unto the
Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“Separate me Barnabas and Saul,”</span>
Acts xiii. 1, 2; the whole church chose
Judas and Silas to be sent to Antioch, Acts
xv. 22; the brethren who travelled in the
church's affairs were chosen by the church,
and are called the church's messengers,
2 Cor. viii. 19, 23; such men only were ordained
elders by Paul and Barnabas who
were chosen and approved by the whole
church, their suffrages being signified by
the lifting up of their hands, Acts xiv. 23.
Albeit, Chrysostom and other ecclesiastical
writers use the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cheirotonia</span></span> for ordination
and imposition of hands, yet when they
take it in this sense, they speak it figuratively
and synecdochically, as Junius showeth.<a id="noteref_1004" name="noteref_1004" href="#note_1004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1004</span></span></a>
For these two, election by most voices,
and ordination by laying on of hands, were
joined together, did cohere, as an antecedent
and a consequent, whence the use obtained,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-327">[pg 1-327]</span><a name="Pg1-327" id="Pg1-327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the whole action should be signified
by one word, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per modum intellectus</span></span>,
collecting the antecedent from the consequent,
and the consequent from the antecedent.
Nevertheless, according to the proper
and native signification of the word, it
noteth the signifying of a suffrage or election
by the lifting up of the hand, for
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cheimotonehin</span></span> is no other
thing nor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">chehiras tehinein</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hanatehineiu</span></span> to lift or hold up the
hands in sign of a suffrage; and so Chrysostom
himself useth the word when he
speaketh properly, for he saith that the senate
of Rome took upon him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cheirosoiehin
theohne</span></span>; that is (as D. Potter turneth his
words<a id="noteref_1005" name="noteref_1005" href="#note_1005"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1005</span></span></a>), to make gods by most voices.

Bellarmine<a id="noteref_1006" name="noteref_1006" href="#note_1006"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1006</span></span></a> reckoneth out three significations
of the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cheirosoiehin</span></span>: 1. To choose
by suffrages; 2. Simply to choose which
way soever it be; 3. To ordain by imposition
of hands. Junius answereth him,<a id="noteref_1007" name="noteref_1007" href="#note_1007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1007</span></span></a>
that the first is the proper signification;
the second is metaphorical; the third synecdochical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our English translators, 2 Cor. i. 19,
have followed the metaphorical signification,
and in this place, Acts xiv. 23, the synecdochical.
But what had they to do either
with a metaphor or a synecdoche when
the text may bear the proper sense? Now
that Luke, in this place, useth the word in
the proper sense, and not in the synecdochical,
Gerhard<a id="noteref_1008" name="noteref_1008" href="#note_1008"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1008</span></span></a> proveth from the words which
he subjoineth, to signify the ordaining of
those elders by the laying on of hands; for
he saith that they prayed, and fasted, and
commended them to the Lord, in which
words he implieth the laying on of hands
upon them, as may be learned from Acts
vi. 6, <span class="tei tei-q">“When they had prayed, they laid
their hands on them;”</span> Acts xiii. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“When
they had fasted, and prayed, and laid their
hands on them;”</span> so Acts viii. 15, 17, prayer
and laying on of hands went together.
Wherefore by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cheirotouhêsagtes</span></span> Luke pointeth
at the election of those elders by voices,
being, in the following words, to make mention
of their ordination by imposition of
hands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cartwright<a id="noteref_1009" name="noteref_1009" href="#note_1009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1009</span></span></a>
hath for the same point other
weighty reasons: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is absurd (saith he) to
imagine that the Holy Ghost, by Luke,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-328">[pg 1-328]</span><a name="Pg1-328" id="Pg1-328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
speaking with the tongues of men, that is to
say, to their understanding, should use a
word in that signification in which it was
never used before his time by any writer,
holy or profane, for how could he then be
understood, if using the note and name they
used, he should have fled from the signification
whereunto they used it, unless therefore
his purpose was to write that which
none could read? It must needs be that as
he wrote so he meant the election by voices.
And if Demosthenes, for knowledge in the
tongue, would have been ashamed to have
noted the laying down of hands by a word
that signifieth the lifting of them up, they
do the Holy Ghost (which taught Demosthenes
to speak) great injury in using this
impropriety and strangeness of speech unto
himself, which is yet more absurd, considering
that there were both proper words to utter
the laying on of hands by, and the same
also was used in the translation of the LXX,
which Luke, for the Gentiles' sake, did, as
it may seem (where he conveniently could),
most follow. And yet it is most of all absurd
that Luke, which straiteneth himself
to keep the words of the seventy interpreters,
when as he could have otherwise uttered
things in better terms than they did,
should here forsake the phrase wherewith
they noted the laying on of hands, being
most proper and natural to signify the
same. The Greek Scholiast also, and the
Greek Ignatius, do plainly refer this word
to the choice of the church by voices.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is objected, that Luke saith not of
the whole church, but only of Paul and Barnabas,
that they made them by voices elders
in every city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> But how can one imagine that betwixt
them two alone the matter went to
suffrages? Election by most voices, or the
lifting up of the hand in taking of a suffrage,
had place only among a multitude assembled
together. Wherefore we say with Junius,<a id="noteref_1010" name="noteref_1010" href="#note_1010"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1010</span></span></a>
that τὸ χειροτονεὶν is both a common
and a particular action whereby a man
chooseth, by his own suffrage in particular,
and likewise with others in common, so
that in one and the same action we cannot
divide those things which are so joined together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From that which hath been said, it plainly
appeareth that the election of ministers,
according to the apostolic institution, pertaineth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-329">[pg 1-329]</span><a name="Pg1-329" id="Pg1-329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the whole body of that church
where they are to serve; and that this was
the apostolic and primitive practice, it is
acknowledged even by some of the Papists,
such as Lorinus, Salmeron, and Gaspar
Sanctius, all upon Acts xiv. 23. The canon
law<a id="noteref_1011" name="noteref_1011" href="#note_1011"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1011</span></span></a>

that the city of Magedeburg should
have <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus vocandi ac constituendi ecclesiae

of peace without this condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That in the ancient church, for a long
time, the election of ministers remained in
the power of the whole church or congregation,
it is evident from Cypr., lib. 1, epist.
4, 68; August., epist. 106; Leo I., epist.
95; Socrat., lib. 4, cap. 30; and lib. 6,
cap. 2; Possidon, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in Vita Aug.</span></span>, cap. 4.
The testimonies and examples themselves,
for brevity's cause, I omit. As for the thirteenth
canon of the Council of Laodicea,
which forbiddeth to permit to the people the
election of such as were to minister at the
altar, we say with Osiander,<a id="noteref_1013" name="noteref_1013" href="#note_1013"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1013</span></span></a> that this canon
cannot be approved, except only in this respect,
that howbeit the people's election and
consent be necessary, yet the election is not
wholly and solely to be committed to them,
excluding the judgment and voice of the
clergy. And that this is all which the Council
meant, we judge with Calvin<a id="noteref_1014" name="noteref_1014" href="#note_1014"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1014</span></span></a> and Gerhard.<a id="noteref_1015" name="noteref_1015" href="#note_1015"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1015</span></span></a> That this is the true interpretation
of the canon, Junius<a id="noteref_1016" name="noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a>
proveth both by the words ὄχλοις ἐπιτρέπειν, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">permittere turbis</span></span>,
for ἐπιτρέπειν signifieth to quit and leave
the whole matter to the fidelity and will of
others; and, likewise, by the common end
and purpose of that Council which was to repress
certain faults of the people which had
prevailed through custom. Indeed, if the
whole matter were altogether left to the
people, contentions and confusions might be
feared; but whilst we plead for the election
of the people, we add,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

nor the clergy's nomination, examination
and recommendation, nor the bishop's
laying on of hands and giving of institution,
nor all these put together, can
make up to a man's calling to be a pastor
to such or such a particular flock, without
their own free election. Even, as in those
places where princes are elected, the election
gives them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus ad rem</span></span> (as they speak),
without which the inauguration can never
give them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus in re</span></span>; so a man hath, from
his election, power to be a pastor so far as
concerneth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus ad rem</span></span>, and ordination only
applieth him to the actual exercising of his
pastoral office, which ordination ought to be
given unto him only who is elected, and that
because he is elected. And of him who is
obtruded and thrust upon a people, without
their own election, it is well said by Zanchius,
that he can neither with a good conscience
exercise his ministry, nor yet be
profitable to the people, because they will
not willingly hear him, nor submit themselves
unto him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, because patronages and presentation
to benefices do often prejudge the
free and lawful election which God's word
craveth, therefore the Second Book of Discipline,
chap. 12, albeit it permitteth and
alloweth the ancient patrons of prebendaries,
and such benefices as have not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curam
animarum</span></span>, to reserve their patronages, and
to dispone thereupon to benefices that have
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curam animarum</span></span>, may have no place in
this light of reformation. Not that we
think a man presented to a benefice that
hath <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curam animarum</span></span> cannot be lawfully
elected, but because of the often and ordinary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-331">[pg 1-331]</span><a name="Pg1-331" id="Pg1-331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abuse of this unnecessary custom, we
could wish it abolished by princes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It followeth to speak of ordination, wherein,
with Calvin,<a id="noteref_1018" name="noteref_1018" href="#note_1018"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1018</span></span></a>

and other learned men, we distinguish betwixt
the act of it and the rite of it. The
act of ordination standeth in the mission to
the deputation of a man to an ecclesiastical
function, with power and authority to perform
the same; and thus are pastors ordained
when they are sent to a people with
power to preach the word, minister the sacraments,
and exercise ecclesiastical discipline
among them. For <span class="tei tei-q">“How shall they
preach except they be sent?”</span> Rom. x. 15.
Unto which mission or ordination neither
prayer nor imposition of hands, nor any
other of the church's rites, is essential and
necessary, as the Archbishop of Spalato showeth,<a id="noteref_1021" name="noteref_1021" href="#note_1021"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1021</span></span></a>
who placeth the essential act of ordination
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">missione potestativa</span></span>, or a simple
deputation and application of a minister to
his ministerial function with power to perform
it. This may be done, saith he, by
word alone, without any other ceremony,
in such sort that the fact should hold, and
the ordination thus given should be valid
enough. When a man is elected by the
suffrages of the church, then his ordination
is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quasi solennis missio in possessionem
honoris illius, ex decreto</span></span>, saith Junius.<a id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href="#note_1022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a>
Chemnitius noteth,<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href="#note_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a> that when Christ, after
he had chosen his twelve apostles, ordained
them to preach the gospel, to cast out devils,
and to heal diseases, we read of no ceremony
used in this ordination, but only
that Christ gave them power to preach, to
heal, and to cast out devils, and so sent them
away to the work. And howsoever the
church hath for order and decency used some
rite in ordination, yet there is no such rite
to be used with opinion of necessity, or as
appointed by Christ or his apostles. When
our writers prove against Papists that order
is no sacrament, this is one of their arguments,
that there is no rite instituted in the
New Testament to be used in the giving of
orders. Yet because imposition of hands
was used in ordination not only by the apostles,
who had power to give extraordinarily
the gifts of the Holy Ghost, but likewise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-332">[pg 1-332]</span><a name="Pg1-332" id="Pg1-332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the presbytery or company of elders;
and Timothy did not only receive the
gift that was in him, by the laying on of
Paul's hands. 2 Tim. i. 16, as the mean,
but also with the laying on of the hands of
the presbytery, 1 Tim. iv. 14, as the rite
and sign of his ordination; therefore the
church, in the after ages, hath still kept and
used the same rite in ordination, which rite
shall, with our leave, be yet retained in the
church, providing, 1. It be not used with
opinion of necessity; for that the church
hath full liberty either to use any other decent
rite (not being determined by the word
to any one), or else to use no rite at all, beside
a public declaration that the person
there presented is called and appointed to
serve the church in the pastoral office, together
with exhortation to the said person,
and the commending of him to the grace of
God, the church not being tied by the word
to use any rite at all in the giving of ordination.
2. That it be not used as a sacred
significant ceremony to represent and signify
either the delivering to the person ordained
authority to preach and to minister
the sacraments, or the consecration and
mancipation of him to the holy ministry;
or, lastly, God's bestowing of the gifts of his
Spirit upon him, together with his powerful
protection and gracious preservation in the
performing of the works of his calling, but
only as a moral sign, solemnly to assign and
point out the person ordained; which, also,
was one of the ends and uses whereunto this
rite of laying on of hands was applied by the
apostles themselves, as Chemnitius showeth.<a id="noteref_1024" name="noteref_1024" href="#note_1024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a>
And so Joshua was designed and known to
the people of Israel as the man appointed
to be the successor of Moses, by that very
sign, that Moses laid his hands on him,
Deut. xxxiv.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a sacred significant ceremony we may
not use it, 1. Because it hath been proved,<a id="noteref_1025" name="noteref_1025" href="#note_1025"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1025</span></span></a>
that men may never, at their pleasure, ascribe
to any rite whatsoever, a holy signification
of some mystery of faith or duty of
piety. The apostles, indeed, by laying on
of their hands, did signify their giving of
the gift of the Holy Ghost; but, now, as
the miracle, so the mystery hath ceased,
and the church not having such power to
make the signification answer to the sign, if
now a sacred or mystical signification be
placed in the rite, it is but an empty and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-333">[pg 1-333]</span><a name="Pg1-333" id="Pg1-333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
void sign, and rather minical than mystical.
2. All such sacred rites as have been notoriously
abused to superstition, if they have
no necessary use, ought to be abolished, as
we have also proven;<a id="noteref_1026" name="noteref_1026" href="#note_1026"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1026</span></span></a>
therefore, if imposition
of hands in ordination be accounted and
used as a sacred rite, and as having a sacred
signification (the use of it not being necessary),
it becometh unlawful, by reason of
the bygone and present superstitious abuse
of the same in Popery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now the right and power of giving ordination
to the ministers of the church belongeth
primarily and wholly to Christ, who communicateth
the same with his bride the
church. Both the bridegroom for his part,
and the bride for her part, have delivered
this power of ordination to the presbytery
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure</span></span> DIVINO. Afterward the presbytery conferred,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure humano</span></span>, this power upon them,
who were specially called bishops, whence
the tyrannical usurpation of bishops hath in
process followed, claiming the proper right
and ordinary position of that which at first
they had only by free concession; and thus
that great divine, Franciscus Junius,<a id="noteref_1027" name="noteref_1027" href="#note_1027"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1027</span></span></a> deriveth
the power of ordination. All which,
that it may be plain unto us, let us observe
four several passages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The whole church<a id="noteref_1028" name="noteref_1028" href="#note_1028"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1028</span></span></a> hath the power
of ordination communicated to her from
Christ, to whom it wholly pertaineth; for,
1. It is most certain (and among our writers
agreed upon) that, to the whole church collectively
taken, Christ hath delivered the
keys of the kingdom of heaven with power
to use the same, promising that whosoever
the church bindeth on earth, shall be bound
in heaven, and whosoever she looseth on
earth, shall be loosed in heaven, Matt. xviii.
18; therefore he hath also delivered unto
the whole church power to call and ordain
ministers for using the keys, otherwise the
promise might be made void, because the
ministers which she now hath may fail. 2.
Christ hath appointed a certain and an ordinary
way how the church may provide
herself of ministers, and so may have ever
in herself the means of grace and comfort
sufficient to herself, according to that of the
Apostle, 1 Cor. iii. 21, 22, <span class="tei tei-q">“All things are
yours, whether Paul or Apollos,”</span> &amp;c. But
if she had not the power of ordaining ministers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-334">[pg 1-334]</span><a name="Pg1-334" id="Pg1-334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unto herself when she needeth, then
might she sometimes be deprived of such an
ordinary and certain way of providing herself.
3. When the ministry of the church
faileth or is wanting, Christian people have
power to exercise that act of ordination
which is necessary to the making of a minister.
Dr Fulk<a id="noteref_1029" name="noteref_1029" href="#note_1029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1029</span></span></a> showeth out of Ruffinus
and Theodoret, that Ædesius and Frumentius,
being but private men, by preaching of
the gospel, converted a great nation of the
Indians; and that the nation of the Iberians
being converted by a captive woman, the
king and the queen became teachers of the
gospel to the people. And might not, then,
the church in those places both elect and
ordain ministers?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The church hath, by divine institution,
delivered the power of ordaining ordinary
ministers to the presbytery, whereof
the church consisteth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">repræsentative</span></span>. And
so saith Pareus,<a id="noteref_1030" name="noteref_1030" href="#note_1030"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1030</span></span></a> that the power of mission
(which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ordination</span></em>) belongeth to the presbytery.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scriptura</span></span>, saith
Balduine,<a id="noteref_1031" name="noteref_1031" href="#note_1031"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1031</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ordinationem

the divines of Germany and Belgia speak of
a presbytery, they understand such a company
as hath in it both those two sorts of
elders which we speak of, viz., some who labour
in the word and doctrine, whom the
Apostle calleth bishops, and others who
labour only in discipline. The apostolic and
primitive times knew neither parishional nor
diocesan churches. Christians lived then in
cities only, not in villages, because of the
persecution; and it is to be remembered,
that in Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, Colosse,
Philippi, Thessalonica, and such other cities
inhabited by Christians, there were more
pastors than one. The Apostle called unto
him the elders (not elder) of the church of
Ephesus, Acts xx. 17; he writeth to the
bishops (not bishop) of the church at Philippi,
Phil. i. 1; he biddeth the Thessalonians
know them (not him) which laboured among
them, 2 Thess. v. 12. Now that number
of pastors or bishops which was in one city,
did in common govern all the churches within
the city, and there was not any one pastor
who, by himself, governed a certain part
of the city particularly assigned to his charge,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-335">[pg 1-335]</span><a name="Pg1-335" id="Pg1-335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to which purpose the Apostle exhorteth the
elders of the church at Ephesus, to take
heed to all the flock, παντι τῳ ποιμιῳ,
Acts xx. 28. And to the same purpose it is
said by Jerome,<a id="noteref_1033" name="noteref_1033" href="#note_1033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1033</span></span></a> that before schemes and
divisions were, by the devil's instigation,
made in religion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">communi presbyterorum
consilio ecclesiæ gubernabantur</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This number of preaching elders in one
city, together with those elders which, in
the same city, laboured for discipline only,
made up that company which the Apostle,<a id="noteref_1034" name="noteref_1034" href="#note_1034"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1034</span></span></a>
1 Tim. iv. 14, calleth a presbytery, and
which gave ordination to the ministers of
the church. To the whole presbytery, made
up of those two sorts of elders, belonged the
act of ordination, which is mission, howbeit
the right,<a id="noteref_1035" name="noteref_1035" href="#note_1035"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1035</span></span></a> which was imposition of hands,
belonged to those elders alone which laboured
in the word and doctrine. And so we
are to understand that which the Apostle
there saith of the presbytery's laying on of
hands upon Timothy. As for Dr Downame's<a id="noteref_1036" name="noteref_1036" href="#note_1036"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1036</span></span></a> two glosses upon that place, which
he borroweth from Bellarmine, and whereby
he thinketh to elude our argument, we
thank Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_1037" name="noteref_1037" href="#note_1037"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1037</span></span></a> for confuting them.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod autem</span></span>, &amp;c.: <span class="tei tei-q">“But whereas (saith he)
some have expounded the presbytery in this
place to be a company of bishops, except by
bishops thou would understand presbyteries,
it is a violent interpretation, and an insolent
meaning, and whereas others have understood
the degree itself of eldership, this cannot
stand, for the degree hath not hands,
but hands are men's.”</span> Wherefore the Doctor
himself, by the presbytery whereof the
Apostle speaketh, understandeth (as we do)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">confessus presbyterorum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But since we cannot find, in the apostles'
times, any other presbytery or assembly of
elders beside that which hath been spoken
of, how cometh it, nay, some say that the
church of Scotland, and other reformed
churches, did appoint two sorts of presbyterial
assemblies, one (which here we call
sessions) wherein the pastor of the parish,
together with those elders within the same,
whom the Apostle calleth governments and
presidents, put order to the government of
that congregation, another (which here we
presbyteries) wherein the pastors of sundry
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-336">[pg 1-336]</span><a name="Pg1-336" id="Pg1-336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
churches, lying near together, do assemble
themselves? Which difficulty yet
more increaseth, if it be objected that neither
of these two doth in all points answer
or conform itself unto that primitive form of
presbytery whereof we speak. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> The
division and multiplication of parishes, and
the appointment of particular pastors to the
peculiar oversight of particular flocks, together
with the plantation of churches in villages
as well as in cities, hath made it impossible
for us to be served with that only
one form of presbytery which was constitute
in the apostles' times. But this difference
of the times being (as it ought to be) admitted,
for an inevitable cause of the differences
of the former, both those two forms of presbyterial
meetings appointed by the church
of Scotland do not only necessarily result
from that one apostolic form, but likewise
(the actions of them both being laid together)
do accomplish all these ordinary ecclesiastical
functions which were by it performed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And first, Sessions have a necessary use,
because the pastors and those elders who assist
them in the governing of their flocks
must, as well conjunctly as severally, as well
publicly as privately, govern, admonish, rebuke,
censure, &amp;c. As for presbyteries, because
the parishes being divided in most
places, there is but one pastor in a parish,
except there should be a meeting of a number
of pastors out of divers parishes, neither
could trial be well had of the growth or decay
of the gifts, graces, and utterance of
every pastor, for which purpose the ninth
head of the First book of Discipline appointed
the ministers of adjacent churches
to meet together at convenient times, in
towns and public places, for the exercise of
prophecying and interpreting of Scripture,
according to that form commended to the
church at Corinth, 1 Cor. xiv. 29-32. For
yet could the churches be governed by the
common council and advice of presbyteries,
which being necessary by apostolic institution,
and being the foundation and ground
of our presbyteries, it maketh them necessary
too.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. After the golden age of the apostles
was spent and away, presbyteries, finding
themselves disturbed with emulations, contentions,
and factions, for unity's sake, chose
one of their number to preside among
them, and to confer, in name of the rest,
the rite and sign of initiation (which was imposition
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-337">[pg 1-337]</span><a name="Pg1-337" id="Pg1-337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of hands) on them whom they ordained
ministers. This honour did the presbyters
yield to him who was specially and
peculiarly called bishop, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure humano</span></span>; yet
the act of ordination they still reserved in
their own power. And wheresoever the
act doth thus remain in the power of the
whole presbytery, the conferring of the outward
sign or rite by one in the name of
the rest, none of us condemneth, as may be
seen in Beza, Didoclavius, and Gersom
Bucer. Neither is there any more meant
by Jerome<a id="noteref_1038" name="noteref_1038" href="#note_1038"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1038</span></span></a> when he saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“What doth a
bishop (ordination being excepted) which a
presbyter may not do?”</span> For, 1. He speaketh
not of the act of ordination, which remained
in the power of the presbytery, but
of the outward sign or rite, which synedochically
he calls ordination.<a id="noteref_1039" name="noteref_1039" href="#note_1039"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1039</span></span></a> 2. He
speaketh only of the custom of that time,
and not of any divine institution; for that
the imposition of hands pertained to the bishop
alone, not by divine institution, but
only by ecclesiastical custom, Junius
proveth<a id="noteref_1040" name="noteref_1040" href="#note_1040"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1040</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Afterward bishops began to appropriate
to themselves that power which pertained
unto them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure devoluto</span></span>, as if it had
been their own <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure proprio</span></span>. Yet so that
some vestiges of the ancient order have still
remained; for both Augustine and Ambrose
(whose words, most plain to this purpose,
are cited by Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_1041" name="noteref_1041" href="#note_1041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a>) testify that,
in their time, in Alexandria and all Egypt,
the presbyters gave ordination when a bishop
was not present. The canon law<a id="noteref_1042" name="noteref_1042" href="#note_1042"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1042</span></span></a> ordaineth
that, in giving of ordination, presbyters
lay on their hands, together with the
bishop's hands. And it is holden by many
Papists (of whom Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_1043" name="noteref_1043" href="#note_1043"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1043</span></span></a> allegeth
some for the same point) that any simple
presbyter (whom they call a priest) may,
with the Pope's commandment or concession,
give valid ordination. That which
maketh them grant so much is, because
they dare not deny that presbyters have
the power of ordination <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>. Yet
saith Panormitanus,<a id="noteref_1044" name="noteref_1044" href="#note_1044"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1044</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Olim presbytery in

a commission from the bishop or from
the presbytery, if either there be no bishop,
or else he be a heretic or wolf. But I would
learn why may not the presbytery validly
ordain, either by themselves, or by any one
presbyter with commission and power from
them, even where there is a bishop (and he
no heretic) who consenteth not thereto; for

ecclesiastical prelates may no way either assemble
themselves together by mutual consent,
or be convocated by the authority of
the metropolitan, primate, or patriarch.
For the apostles did celebrate councils without
any convocation of princes. So many
councils that were celebrate before the first
Nicea, were, without all doubt, gathered
together by the means alone of ecclesiastical
persons; for to whom directly the church
is fully committed, they ought to bear the
care of the church. Yet princes in some
respect indirectly, for help and aid, chiefly
then when the prelates neglect to convocate
councils, or are destitute of power for
doing of the same, of duty may, and use to
convocate them.”</span> Where we see his judgment
to be, that the power of convocating
councils pertaineth directly to ecclesiastical
persons, and to princes only indirectly, for
that they ought to give help and aid to the
convocation of the same, especially when
churchmen either will not or cannot assemble
themselves together. His reasons whereupon
he groundeth his judgment are two,
and those strong ones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The apostolical councils, Acts vi. 2;
iv. 16, and so many as were assembled before
the first council of Nice, were not convocated
by princes, but by ecclesiastical persons
without the leave of princes; therefore,
in the like cases, the church ought to
use the like liberty, that is, when there is
need of synods, either for preventing or reforming
some corruptions in the doctrine or
policy of the church; and for avoiding such
inconveniences as may impede the course of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-340">[pg 1-340]</span><a name="Pg1-340" id="Pg1-340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the gospel (princes in the meantime being
hostile opposites to the truth of God and to
the purity of religion), then to convocate the
same without their authority and leave.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The church is fully committed (and
that directly) to the ministers whom Christ
hath set to rule over the same; therefore
they ought to take care and to provide for
all her necessities as those who must give
account, and be answerable to God for any
hurt which she receiveth in things spiritual
or ecclesiastical, for which (when they might)
they did not provide a remedy, which being
so, it followeth, that when princes will neither
convocate synods, nor consent to the
convocating of them, yet if the convocating
of a synod be a necessary mean for healing
of the church's hurt, and ecclesiastical persons
be able (through the happy occasion of
a fit opportunity) synodically to assemble
themselves, in that case they ought by themselves
to come together, unless one would
say that princes alone, and not pastors, must
give account to God how it hath gone with
the church in matters spiritual and ecclesiastical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If it be objected that our divines maintain
against Papists, that the right and
power of convocating synods pertaineth to
princes: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span>, And so say I; but for
making the purpose more plain I add three
directions: 1. In ordinary cases, and when
princes are not enemies to the truth and
purity of the gospel, ecclesiastical persons
should not do well to assemble themselves
together in a synod, except they be convocate
with the authority or consent of princes.
Yet, as Junius showeth,<a id="noteref_1052" name="noteref_1052" href="#note_1052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1052</span></span></a> in extraordinary
cases, and when the magistrate will not concur
nor join with the church, the church
may well assemble and come together beside
his knowledge, and without his consent,
for that extraordinary evils must have extraordinary
remedies. 2. Ecclesiastical persons
may convocate councils simply, and by
a spiritual power and jurisdiction; but to
convocate them by a temporal and coactive
power, pertaineth to princes only. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical
power (saith the Archbishop of Spalato<a id="noteref_1053" name="noteref_1053" href="#note_1053"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1053</span></span></a>)
may appoint and convocate councils;
but yet the ecclesiastical power itself cannot,
with any effect or working, compel bishops,
especially if the bishops of another province,
or kingdom, or patriarchship, be to be convocated.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-341">[pg 1-341]</span><a name="Pg1-341" id="Pg1-341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
For because the church can work
by her censures, and deprive them who refuse
of her communion, if they come not,
yet they shall not therefore come to the
council if they contemn the censure; therefore
that no man may be able to resist, it is
necessary that they be called by a coactive
authority, which can constrain them who
gainstand, both with banishments and bodily
punishments, and compel the bishops, not
only of one province, but also of the whole
kingdom or empire, to convene.”</span> 3. In the
main and substantial respects, the convocations
of councils pertaineth to the ministers
of the church, that is, as councils are ecclesiastical
meetings, for putting order to ecclesiastical
matters, they ought to be assembled
by the spiritual power of the ministers,
whose part it is to espy and note all the
misorders and abuses in the church, which
must be righted; but because councils are
such meetings as must have a certain place
designed for them in the dominions and
territories of princes, needing further, for
their safe assembling, a certification of their
princely protection; and, finally, it being
expedient for the better success of councils,
that Christian princes be present therein,
either personal or by their commissioners,
that they may understand the councils, conclusions,
and decrees, and assenting unto the
same, ratify and establish them by their regal
and royal authority, because of these
circumstances it is, that the consent and
authority of Christian princes is, and ought
to be, sought and expected for the assembling
of synods.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for the right of presidency and moderation,
we distinguish, with Junius,<a id="noteref_1054" name="noteref_1054" href="#note_1054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1054</span></span></a> two sorts
of it, both which have place in councils, viz.,
the moderation of the ecclesiastical action,
and the moderation of the human order;
and with him we say, that in councils, the
whole ecclesiastical action ought to be moderated
by such a president as is elected
for the purpose; even as Hosius, bishop of
Corduba, was chosen to preside in the first
council of Nice: which office agreeth not
with princes; for in the point of propounding
rightly the state of questions and things
to be handled, and of containing the disputation
in good order, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">certe præsidere debet

that is, by a coactive power to compass
the turbulent, to avoid all confusion and contention,
and to cause a peaceable proceeding
and free deliberation, pertaineth indeed to
princes, and so did Constantine preside in
the same council of Nice.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">OF THE JUDGING OF CONTROVERSIES AND QUESTIONS OF FAITH.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a twofold judgment which discerneth
and judgeth of faith. The one absolute,
whereby the Most High God, whose
supreme authority alone bindeth us to believe
whatsoever he propoundeth to be believed
by us, hath in his written word pronounced,
declared, and established, what he
would have us to believe concerning himself
or his worship; the other limited and subordinate,
which is either public or private.
That which is public is either ordinary or
extraordinary. The ministerial or subordinate
public judgment, which I call ordinary,
is the judgment of every pastor or doctor,
who, by reason of his public vocation
and office, ought by his public ministry to
direct and instruct the judgments of other
men in matters of faith, which judgment of
pastors and doctors is limited and restricted
to the plain warrants and testimonies of
Holy Scripture, they themselves being only
the ambassadors<a id="noteref_1056" name="noteref_1056" href="#note_1056"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1056</span></span></a> of the Judge to preach and
publish the sentence which he hath established,
so that a pastor is not properly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judex</span></span>
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">index</span></span>. The subordinate public judgment,
which is extraordinary, is the judgment
of a council assembled for the more
public and effectual establishment and declaration
of one or more points of faith and
heads of Christian doctrine, and that in opposition
to all contrary heresy or error,
which is broached and set a-foot in the
church. From which council,<a id="noteref_1057" name="noteref_1057" href="#note_1057"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1057</span></span></a> no Christian
man who is learned in the Scriptures
may be excluded, but ought to be admitted
to utter his judgment in the same; for in
the indagation or searching out of a matter
of faith, they are not the persons of men
which give authority to their sayings, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-343">[pg 1-343]</span><a name="Pg1-343" id="Pg1-343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the reasons and documents which every one
bringeth for his judgment. The subordinate
judgment, which I call private, is the
judgment of discretion whereby every Christian,<a id="noteref_1058" name="noteref_1058" href="#note_1058"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1058</span></span></a>
for the certain information of his own
mind, and the satisfaction of his own conscience,
may and ought to try and examine,
as well the decrees of councils as the doctrines
of particular pastors, and in so far to
receive and believe the same, as he understandeth
them to agree with the Scriptures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides these, there is no other kind of
judgment which God hath allowed to men
in matters of faith, which being first observed,
we say next, concerning the part of
princes, that when questions and controversies
of faith are tossed in the church, that
which pertaineth to them is, to convocate a
council for the decision of the matter, civilly
to moderate the same, by causing such an
orderly and peaceable proceeding as is alike
necessary in every grave assembly, whether
of the church or of the commonwealth; and,
finally, by their coactive temporal power to
urge and procure that the decrees of the
council be received, and the faith therein
contained professed, by their subjects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But neither may they, by their own authority
and without a council, decide any controverted
matter of faith, nor yet having
convocated a council, may they take upon
them to command, rule, order, and dispose
the disputes and deliberations according to
their arbitrement; nor, lastly, may they,
by virtue of their regal dignity, claim any
power to examine the decrees concluded in
the council, otherwise than by the judgment
of private discretion which is common to
every Christian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, I say, they may not by themselves
presume, publicly and judicially, to decide
and define any matter of faith, which is
questioned in the church; but this definition
they ought to remit unto a lawful and
free council. Ambrose would not come to
the court to be questioned and judged by the
emperor Valentinian in a matter of faith,
whenever he heard that emperors judged
bishops in matters of faith, seeing, if that
were granted, it would follow that laymen
should dispute and debate matters, and bishops
hear, yea, that bishops should learn of
laymen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The true ground of which refusal (clear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-344">[pg 1-344]</span><a name="Pg1-344" id="Pg1-344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enough in itself) is darkened by Dr Field,<a id="noteref_1059" name="noteref_1059" href="#note_1059"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1059</span></span></a>
who allegeth, 1. That the thing which Valentinian
took on him was, to judge of a
thing already resolved in a general council
called by Constantine, as if it had been free,
and not yet judged of at all. 2. That Valentinian
was known to be partial; that he
was but a novice; and the other judges
which he meant to associate himself suspected;
but howsoever these circumstances
might serve the more to justify Ambrose's
not compearing to be judged in a matter of
faith by Valentinian, yet the Doctor toucheth
not that which is most considerable,
namely, the reason which he alleged for
his not compearing, because it hath been at
no time heard of that emperors judged bishops
in matters of faith, and if that were
granted, it would follow that bishops should
learn of laymen; which reason holdeth ever
good, even though the thing hath not been
formerly judged by a council.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, furthermore, if those (which the
Doctor mentioneth) were the true reasons
of his refusing to be judged by Valentinian,
then why did he pretend another reason
(whereof we have heard), and not rather defend
himself with the real and true reason?
Wherefore we gather, that the reason which
made Ambrose refuse to be judged by him
was no other than this, because he considered
that princes, neither by themselves, nor
by any whom they please to choose, may,
without a lawfully assembled and free council,
usurp a public judgment and decisive
sentence in controversies of faith, which, if
they arrogate to themselves, they far exceed
the bounds of their vocation; for it is not
said of princes, but of priests, that their lips
should preserve knowledge, and that they
should seek the law from their mouths, Mal.
ii. 7. And the priests did Jehoshaphat set
in <span class="tei tei-q">“Jerusalem, for the judgment of the
Lord, and for controversies,”</span> 2 Chron. xix.
8, 10, and for judging betwixt law and commandment,
statutes and judgments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meanwhile we deny not but that
in extraordinary cases, when lawful councils
cannot be had, and when the clergy is universally
corrupted through gross ignorance,
perverse affections, and incorrigible negligence,
in such a case the prince, notwithstanding
the defect of the ordinary and regular
judges, may yet, by the power of the
civil sword, repress and punish so many as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-345">[pg 1-345]</span><a name="Pg1-345" id="Pg1-345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
publish and spread such doctrines as both
he and other Christians, by the judgment of
discretion, plainly understand from Scripture
to be heretical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next, I say, that the prince, having assembled
a council, may not take so much
upon him as imperiously to command what
he thinketh good in the disputes and deliberations,
and to have everything ordered,
disposed, and handled according to his mind.
<span class="tei tei-q">“To debate and define theological controversies,
and to teach what is orthodoxal,
what heretical, is the office of divines, yet,
by a coactive authority, to judge this orthodox
faith to be received by all, and heretical
pravity to be rejected, is the office of
kings, or the supreme magistrates, in every
commonwealth,”</span> saith the Bishop of Salisbury.<a id="noteref_1060" name="noteref_1060" href="#note_1060"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1060</span></span></a>
And, again,<a id="noteref_1061" name="noteref_1061" href="#note_1061"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1061</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“In searching, directing,
teaching, divines ordinarily, and by reason
of their calling, ought to go before kings
themselves; but in commanding, establishing,
compelling, kings do far excel:”</span> where
he showeth how, in defining of the controversies
of religion, in one respect ecclesiastical
persons, and in another respect kings,
have the first place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the debating of a question of faith,
kings have not, by virtue of their princely
vocation, any precedency or chief place, the
action being merely ecclesiastical. For howbeit
kings may convocate a council, preside
also and govern the same as concerning the
human and political order, yet, saith Junius,<a id="noteref_1062" name="noteref_1062" href="#note_1062"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1062</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Actiones, deliberationes, et definitiones, ad
substantiam rei ecclesiasticae pertinentes,
a sacerdotio sunt, a caetu servoram Dei,
quibus rei suoe administrationem mandavit
Deus.</span></span> And, with him, the Archbishop
of Spalato saith, in like manner,<a id="noteref_1063" name="noteref_1063" href="#note_1063"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1063</span></span></a> that howbeit
Christian princes have convocated councils,
and civilly governed the same, yet they
had no power nor authority in the very discussing,
handling and deciding of matters of
faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then? In the handling of controversies
of faith, have princes no place nor
power at all beside that of political government
only? Surely, by virtue of their
princely authority, they have no other place
in the handling of these matters. Yet,
what if they be men of singular learning
and understanding in the Scriptures? Then
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-346">[pg 1-346]</span><a name="Pg1-346" id="Pg1-346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
let them propound their own suffrage, with
the grounds and reasons of it, even as other
learned men in the council do. But neither
as princes, nor as men singularly learned,
may they require that others in the council
shall dispute and debate matters, and that
they themselves shall sit as judges having
judicial power of a negative voice; for in a
council no man's voice hath any greater
strength than his reasons and probation
have. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non enim admitto</span></span>, &amp;c: <span class="tei tei-q">“For I
admit not in a council (saith the same prelate<a id="noteref_1064" name="noteref_1064" href="#note_1064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1064</span></span></a>)
some as judges, others as disputators,
for I have showed that a conciliary judgment
consisteth in the approbation of that
sentence which, above others, hath been
showed to have most weight, and to which
no man could enough oppose. Wherefore
no man in the council ought to have a judiciary
voice, unless he be withal a disputator,
and assigns a reason wherefore he assigns to
that judgment and repels another, and that
reason such a one as is drawn from the
Scripture only, and from antiquity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, I hold, that, after the definition
and decision of a council, princes may not
take upon them, by any judicial power or
public vocation, to examine the same, as if
they had authority to pronounce yet another
decisive sentence, either ratifying or reversing
what the council hath decreed. Most
certain it is, that, before princes give their
royal assent unto the decrees of any council
whatsoever, and compel men to receive and
acknowledge the same, they ought, first of
all, carefully to try and examine them whether
they agree with the Scriptures or not;
and, if they find them not to agree with the
Scriptures, then to deny their assent and
authority thereto. But all the princes do
not by any judicial power or public authority,
but only by the judgment of private
discretion, which they have as Christians,
and which, together with them, is common
also to their subjects; for neither may a
master of a family commend to his children
and servants the profession of that faith
which is published by the decrees of a council,
except, in like manner, he examine the
same by the Scriptures.

common, and agree unto all, as excommunication
and absolution; or such as are peculiar,
and agree only to men of ecclesiastical
order, as suspension, deprivation, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As touching the power of the keys, to
bind and loose, excommunicate and absolve;
first of all, princes are to remember, that
neither they may, by themselves, exercise
this power (for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regum est corporalem irrogare
paenam; sacerdotum spiritualem inferre
vindictam</span></span><a id="noteref_1065" name="noteref_1065" href="#note_1065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1065</span></span></a>), nor yet by their deputies
or commissioners in their name, and with
authority from them; because, as they have
not themselves the power of the keys, so
neither can they communicate the same unto
others. Secondly, Forasmuch as princes
are the wardens, defenders, and revengers of
both the Tables, they ought, therefore, to
provide and take course that neither laymen
be permitted to have and exercise, the power
of excommunication, nor yet that the prelates
themselves be suffered, in their particular
dioceses, to appropriate this power and
external jurisdiction, as peculiar to themselves;
but that it remain in their hands to
whom it pertaineth by divine institution.
What a woeful abuse is it, that, in our
neighbour churches of England and Ireland,
the bishop's vicar-general, or official,
or commissary, being oftentimes such a one
as hath never entered into any holy orders,
shall sit in his courts to use (I should have
said abuse) the power of excommunication
and absolution? And what though some
silly presbyter be present in the court?
Doth not the bishop's substitute, being a
layman, examine and judge the whole matter,
decree, and give sentence what is to be
done? Hath he not the presbyter's tongue
tied to his belt? And what doth the presbyter
more but only pronounce the sentence
according to that which he who sitteth judge
in the court hath decreed and decerned?
As touching the prelates themselves, I pray,
by what warrant have they appropriated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-348">[pg 1-348]</span><a name="Pg1-348" id="Pg1-348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to themselves the whole external jurisdiction
of binding and loosing, excommunicating
and absolving? But that we may a little
scan this their usurpation, and discover
the iniquity thereof to the view of the
princes, whose part it is to cause the same
to be reformed, let us consider to whom
Christ himself, who hath the key of David
(Rev. iii. 7), who openeth and no man shutteth,
and shutteth and no man openeth, hath
committed this power of the keys to be used
on earth. And, first, Let us distinguish betwixt
the power itself, and the execution of it.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. It pertaineth to the whole church,
collectively taken, to deny her Christian
communion to such wicked persons as add
contumacy to their disobedience: therefore,
it pertaineth to the whole church to excommunicate
them. Again, it pertaineth to
the whole church to admit and receive one
into her communion and familiar fellowship:
therefore, to the whole church it
likewise pertaineth to cast one out of her
communion. Sure, the sentence of excommunication
is pronounced in vain, except
the whole church cut off the person thus
judged from all communion with her: and
the sentence of absolution is to as little purpose
pronounced, except the whole church
admit one again to have communion with
her. Shortly, the whole church hath the
power of punishing a man, by denying her
communion unto him: therefore, the whole
church hath the power of judging that he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-349">[pg 1-349]</span><a name="Pg1-349" id="Pg1-349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ought to be so punished. The whole church
hath the power of remitting this punishment
again: therefore, the whole church hath the
power of judging that it ought to be remitted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Apostle, in 1 Cor. v., showeth
that the Israelites' purging away of leaven
out of their dwellings in the time of the
passover, was a figure of excommunication,
whereby disobedient and obstinate
sinners, who are as leaven to infect other
men, are to be avoided and thrust out of
the church. Now, as the purging away of
the leaven did not peculiarly belong unto
any one, or some few, among the Israelites,
but unto the whole congregation of Israel;
so the Apostle, writing to the whole church
of Corinth, even to as many as should take
care to have the whole lump kept unleavened,
saith to them all, <span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye not that a
little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
Purge out, therefore, the old leaven. Put
away from among yourselves that wicked
person,”</span> 1 Cor. v. 6, 7, 13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Christ hath delivered the power of
binding and loosing to every particular
church or congregation, collectively taken,
which thus we demonstrate:—If our brother
who trespasseth against us will neither
be reclaimed by private admonition, nor yet
by a rebuke given him before some more
witnesses, then, saith Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell it unto
the church; but if he neglect to hear the
church, let him be unto thee as an heathen
man and a publican. Verily, I say unto
you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever
ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven,”</span> Matt. xviii. 17, 18: where he
showeth, that, in the Christian church
(which he was to plant by the ministry
of the apostles), excommunication was to
be used as the last remedy for curing of
the most deadly and desperate evils; which
excommunication he setteth forth by allusion
unto the order and custom of the Jews
in his time, among whom they who were
cast out, and excommunicate from the synagogue,
were accounted as heathens and
publicans. And so when he saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
him be unto thee as an heathen man and a
publican,”</span> he presupposeth that the church
hath excommunicated him for his contumacy,
which he hath added to his disobedience.
For, as Pareus saith,<a id="noteref_1070" name="noteref_1070" href="#note_1070"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1070</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If by me, and thee,
and every one, he is to be accounted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-350">[pg 1-350]</span><a name="Pg1-350" id="Pg1-350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for such a man, it must needs be
that the judgment of the church be, by
public declaration, made known to me, and
thee, and every one. And this meaning is
thoroughly drawn out of the following verse—<span class="tei tei-q">‘For
whatsoever ye shall bind on earth,’</span>
&amp;c.; therefore, the church ought first to
bind him before he ought to be accounted
by me or thee for one bound, that is,
excommunicate.”</span> Now, what meaneth
Christ by the church, to which he giveth
the power of binding and loosing? Not the
church universal, sure; for I cannot tell
the church universal (whether it be understood
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">collective</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">representative</span></em>) whensoever
my brother trespasseth against me,
and will not be reformed. He meaneth,
therefore, the particular church, whereof,
for the time, it shall happen one to be a
member. <span class="tei tei-q">“The power of the keys (saith
Perkins<a id="noteref_1071" name="noteref_1071" href="#note_1071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1071</span></span></a>) is given to all ministers, churches,
and congregations.”</span> Neither could there,
otherwise, an ordinary, perpetual, and ready
course be had, for the correcting of all public
contumacy and scandal, by the means of
ecclesiastical discipline. But it will be said,
when he biddeth us tell that particular
church whereof we are members, he meaneth
not that we should tell the whole body
of that church <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">collective</span></em>, but that we should
tell the governors of the church, who are
the church <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">representative</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How, then, is this place alleged to prove
that the whole church <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">collective</span></em> hath power
and authority to bind and loose?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Christ meaneth, indeed, that we
should tell those governors who represent
the church; but whilst he calleth them by
the name of the church, and sendeth us to
them as to those who represent the church,
he plainly insinuateth that they exercise the
power of the keys (as in his name, so) in the
name of the church, and that this power
and authority pertaineth to the whole church,
even as when one man representeth another
man's person, whatsoever power he exerciseth
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eo nomine</span></span>, doth first of all agree to the
man who is represented.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The Apostle, in his own proper person,
writing to the whole church at Corinth,
1 Cor. v. 4, 5, will have them (being
gathered together) to deliver that incestuous
person to Satan; therefore, every
particular church or congregation hath
power to excommunicate such a contumacious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-351">[pg 1-351]</span><a name="Pg1-351" id="Pg1-351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sinner as that incestuous person was.
It is the common answer of Papists, that
albeit the Apostle commanded the act
should be done in face of the church, yet
the judgment and authority of giving sentence
was in himself alone, and not in the
church of Corinth, whereupon they would
make it to follow, that the power of excommunication
pertaineth to the bishop alone,
and not the church. And the same answer
doth Saravia return to Beza;<a id="noteref_1072" name="noteref_1072" href="#note_1072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1072</span></span></a> but, howsoever,
the Apostle saith, that he had already
judged concerning the incestuous person,
yet he did not hereby seclude the church of
Corinth from the authority of excommunicating
him. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is to be observed (saith
Calvin<a id="noteref_1073" name="noteref_1073" href="#note_1073"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1073</span></span></a>) that Paul, albeit he was an apostle,
doth not for his own will excommunicate
alone, but communicateth his council with
the church, that the thing may be done by
common authority. Himself, indeed, goeth
before and showeth the way, but whilst he
adjoineth to himself other partakers, he signifieth
sufficiently that it is not the private
power of one man.”</span> Nay, let us farther
observe with Junius,<a id="noteref_1074" name="noteref_1074" href="#note_1074"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1074</span></span></a> that the apostles hath
a twofold power: one common to them with
other presbyters, 1 Pet. v. 1; another, singular,
proper, and extraordinary, which they
had as apostles. By this singular power
Paul saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“What will ye? shall I come
unto you with a rod?”</span> 1 Cor. iv. 21; but
by the common power it was that he said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“When ye are gathered together, and my
spirit,”</span> &amp;c., 1 Cor. v. 4. By no other power
than that which was common to him with
the rest of the presbyters or bishops in
Corinth did he judge the incestuous person
to be excommunicated; and thus, as though
he had been present in body among the other
presbyters of that church, and assembled together
with them in their ordinary council or
consistory (in which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fuerunt liberi apostoli,
alii vero presbyteri ex vocatione propria, et
necessitate officii</span></span><a id="noteref_1075" name="noteref_1075" href="#note_1075"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1075</span></span></a>), so he both pronounceth<a id="noteref_1076" name="noteref_1076" href="#note_1076"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1076</span></span></a>
his own judgment, and likewise goeth before,
by pronouncing that judgment which was to
be in common by them pronounced. Furthermore,
that the Apostle would not have
that incestuous man to be excommunicate by
his own authority alone, but by the authority
of the church of Corinth, thus it appeareth:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-352">[pg 1-352]</span><a name="Pg1-352" id="Pg1-352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The Apostle challengeth and condemneth
the Corinthians, 1 Cor. v. 2, 6, 9, because
they had not excommunicate him before
his writing unto them, which he would
never have done if that church had not had
power and authority of excommunication.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Howbeit the Apostle gave his judgment,
that he should be excommunicate, because
he ought not to have been tolerated in
the church, yet, for all that, he should not
have been indeed excommunicate and thrust
out of the church of Corinth, except the
ministers and elders of that church had, in
name of the whole body of the same, judicially
cast him forth and delivered him to
Satan, which plainly argueth that he should
not have been excommunicate by the Apostle's
authority alone, but by the authority
of the church of Corinth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The Apostle only showeth that he
should be excommunicate, but referreth the
giving of sentence and judgment upon him
to the Corinthians; for he saith not that the
Corinthians, being gathered together, should
declare or witness that such an one was delivered
to Satan by Paul's own power and
authority, but that they themselves should
deliver him to Satan, ver. 4, 5. And
again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Purge out, therefore, the old leaven;
put away from among yourselves that
wicked person,”</span> ver. 7, 13. But, saith
Saravia,<a id="noteref_1077" name="noteref_1077" href="#note_1077"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1077</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">partes apostoli in illa actione
fuerunt authoritatis, ecclesiae vero Corinthiacae,
obedientiae. Ans.</span></span> That the action
was done by the authority of the church of
Corinth, it is manifest both from that which
hath been said, and likewise if further we
consider that the Apostle ascribeth to the
Corinthians as much authority in this action
as he assumeth to himself. For he
saith of himself, that he had judged concerning
him that had done this deed, ver. 3;
and so he saith of them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not ye judge
them that are within?”</span> ver. 12. Where he
speaketh not of the judgment of private discretion
(for so they might have judged them
that were without also), but even of the external
and authoritative judgment of ecclesiastical
discipline. The Apostle, indeed,
saith, 2 Cor. ii. 9, that he wrote to the Corinthians
to excommunicate that person,
that he might know them, whether they
were obedient in all things; but this proveth
not that the authority of the excommunication
was not theirs; for their part in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-353">[pg 1-353]</span><a name="Pg1-353" id="Pg1-353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this action proceeded both from authority
and from obedience: from authority, absolutely;
from obedience in, in some respect.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De jure</span></span> they had no liberty nor power not
to excommunicate him, but were bound to
do that which Paul pointed out to be their
duty, and in that respect he calleth them
obedient; yet absolutely and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> it
was free to them (notwithstanding of Paul's
writing to them) either to excommunicate
him or not to excommunicate him, and if
they had not by their authority excommunicate
him, he had not been at all excommunicate
by any virtue of Paul's adjudging
of him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. When the Corinthians proceeded to
excommunicate him, the Apostle calleth
this a censure which was inflicted of many,
ver. 6, which could not be said if he was to
be excommunicate by the Apostle's authority
alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The Apostle, ver. 7, writeth again to
the Corinthians, to forgive the incestuous
man, to receive him into their communion,
and to remit the punishment of his excommunication,
because he was won to repentance.
And he addeth, ver. 10, <span class="tei tei-q">“To whom
ye forgive anything, I forgive also.”</span> Now,
who can remit the punishment and save one
from underlying the censure, except such as
have the power and authority of judgment?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hitherto we have proven that the power
of binding and loosing pertaineth to every
particular church collectively taken; but
the execution and judicial exercising of this
power pertaineth to that company and assembly
of elders in every church which the

In Scotland we call it a session; in France
it is called a consistory; in Germany and
Belgia, according to the Scripture phrase,
it is termed a presbytery. It is made up of
the pastor or pastors of every congregation,

the manner of the particular churches in
Helvetia, to choose unto themselves a certain
senate of elders, or company of the best
men in the church, which might, according
to the canon of holy Scripture, exercise the
discipline of excommunication, which form
is well warranted by the Scriptures; for
when Christ committeth the authority of
binding and loosing unto the church, Matt.
viii. 17, 18, however the power and authority
itself pertain to any particular church
collectively taken, as hath been said, yet the
execution of the same is committed to the
consistory or senate of elders which representeth
that church, and which Paul calleth
a presbytery. Zanchius saith that Chrysostom,<a id="noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080" href="#note_1080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a>

church, since hearers also pertain to the definition
thereof, but the presbytery can represent
the church, whereunto not only they
pertain who labour in the word, but also
elders or governors put in authority for expeding
of ecclesiastical matters in name of
the whole church:”</span> we grant, then, that
by the church, Christ meaneth that company

as the church consisteth of two integrant
parts, viz., pastors and sheep, teachers
and hearers, we therefore deny that the
representative church whereof Christ speaketh,
can be any other than that ecclesiastical
consistory whereof we have spoken.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, albeit the Apostle wrote to
the whole church of Corinth to deliver the
incestuous man to Satan, because the matter
could not be otherwise done, but only in the
name and with the consent of that whole
church; yet he never meant that the common
promiscuous multitude should, by their
suffrages and voices, examine and judge that
cause. But, saith Calvin,<a id="noteref_1086" name="noteref_1086" href="#note_1086"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1086</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Because the
multitude, unless it be governed by council,
never doth anything moderately nor gravely,
there was ordained in the ancient church
(meaning the apostolic church) a presbytery;
that is, a company of elders which, by the
consent of all, had the first judgment and
examination of things; from it the matter
was carried to the people, but being already
determined before.”</span> Again, when the
Apostle writeth to them in his second epistle
that they should forgive him, because he
hath repented, thus he reasoneth: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sufficient
to such a man is this censure which
was inflicted of many,”</span> 2 Cor. ii. 6. Which
words, that we may the better understand,
it is worthy of observation (which not Calvin
only,<a id="noteref_1087" name="noteref_1087" href="#note_1087"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1087</span></span></a>
but Saravia also noteth<a id="noteref_1088" name="noteref_1088" href="#note_1088"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1088</span></span></a>), that it
appeareth from this place, he was not to excommunicate,
but, by sharp rebukes, timeously
win to repentance, whereby the Apostle
showeth it to be needless, yea, most inconvenient,
to proceed against him to the
extremity of discipline. The word ἐπιτιμία,
there used by the Apostle, signifieth rebuke,
reprehension, or chiding, saith Dr Fulk;<a id="noteref_1089" name="noteref_1089" href="#note_1089"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1089</span></span></a>
and so Scapula taketh it to be the same with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-356">[pg 1-356]</span><a name="Pg1-356" id="Pg1-356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ἐπιτίμησις and to signify another thing than
ἐπιτίμιον or ἐπιτιμημα. Beza and Tremellius
turn ἐπιπμία by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">increpatio</span></span>; Ar. Montanus
readeth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">objurgatio</span></span>. This chiding or
threatening of the man proceeded not from
the whole church of Corinth, but only from
many therein, as is plain from the text, and
as Saravia also granteth.<a id="noteref_1090" name="noteref_1090" href="#note_1090"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1090</span></span></a> And who were
the πλέιοιες, those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many</span></em> of whom the
Apostle speaketh? Not such as, from
Christian and brotherly charity, did privately
chide and rebuke him, for the matter
was not then depending in private rebukes,
but by the Apostle's direction it was brought
to the church's part and to public discipline,
the scandal itself being so public and notoriously
manifest; they were, therefore, such
as had public office and authority to chide
him. And who were those but the consistory
of pastors and elders which represented
the whole church, and were set in authority
for judging and managing of things pertaining
to ecclesiastical discipline? They (no
doubt) being met together, called the man
before them, and did most sharply rebuke
him and chide with him, and threatened
that they would not only debar him from
the Lord's table (which is called lesser
excommunication, but more properly a step or
degree tending next to excommunication),
but also wholly cast him out of the church
and deliver him to Satan. Whereupon the
man being made to see the grievousness of
his sin, and the terrible punishment which
was to follow upon it, becometh most sorrowful,
humble, and penitent. And this
moved the Apostle to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sufficient to
such a man,”</span> &amp;c., as if he would say, What
needeth him now to be excommunicate, and
so to be corrected and put to shame by you
all, when every one of you shall deny to
him your Christian communion, as one wholly
cast out of the church? Is it not enough
that many among you, even your whole
presbytery, hath put him to such public
shame by their sharp reprehensions, and to
so great fear by their dreadful threatenings?
And since, through the blessing of God upon
these means, he is already win to repentance,
why would you have him yet more
publicly corrected and rejected by all and
every one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And further, the Apostle addeth, that
now they should not only forgive and comfort
him, ver. 7, but also confirm (κυρῶσαι)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-357">[pg 1-357]</span><a name="Pg1-357" id="Pg1-357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their love towards him, ver. 8. Now κύροω
signifieth to confirm or ratify by authority;
and so Chemnitius,<a id="noteref_1091" name="noteref_1091" href="#note_1091"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1091</span></span></a> Bullinger,<a id="noteref_1092" name="noteref_1092" href="#note_1092"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1092</span></span></a>
and Cartwright,<a id="noteref_1093" name="noteref_1093" href="#note_1093"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1093</span></span></a>
expoundeth it in this place. It
cometh from κῦρος, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">authority</span></span>, whence cometh
also κύριος, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lord</span></span>, or one having authority.
As, therefore, the presbytery, or
company of pastors and elders, had, by
their authority, established that he was to
be excommunicate, and determined to proceed
to the execution of extreme discipline
against him, so now the Apostle would have
them, by the same authority, to ratify and
establish the remission of this punishment
unto him, and to decree that the church
should not deny her communion unto him.
For this authority of binding and loosing,
though it pertained to the whole church, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in
actu primo sive in esse</span></span>, yet it pertained to
the presbytery alone, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu secundo sive
in operara</span></span>; and even as the act of speaking
pertaineth to a man, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
quod</span></span>, but to the tongue alone, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
quo</span></span>; so albeit the power of the keys
doth primarily and principally belong to
the church, collectively taken, yet the actual
execution of this power belongeth only
to the presbytery which representeth the
church, and unto which the church hath
committed her authority to bind and loose.
Wherefore, since the Apostle writeth to the
whole church of Corinth to confirm, by their
authority, their love to the penitent man;
and since this authority, in the actual execution
of it (which the Apostle craveth) did
not agree to that whole church, collectively
taken, we must needs understand his meaning
to be, that their love towards that man,
and their forgiving of him, should be ratified
and confirmed by the authority of those
church governors, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qui ecclesiae nomen ad
coetum repraesentant, totius nimirum presbyterii
authoritate atque consensu</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus have we showed that the actual
use of the keys, or the execution of the
authority of binding and loosing, pertaineth
to that ecclesiastical senate in every particular
church, which the Apostle calleth
a presbytery. For further illustration of
the truth whereof, I add these four observations:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. We must distinguish<a id="noteref_1094" name="noteref_1094" href="#note_1094"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1094</span></span></a> a twofold power
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-358">[pg 1-358]</span><a name="Pg1-358" id="Pg1-358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the keys: the one is executed in doctrine;
the other in discipline: the one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concionalis</span></span>;
the other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judicialis</span></span>. Touching
the former, we grant it is proper for pastors
alone, whose office and vocation it is,
by the preaching and publishing of God's
word, to shut the kingdom of heaven against
impenitent and disobedient men, and to
open it unto penitent sinners; to bind God's
heavy wrath upon the former, and (by application
of the promises of mercy) to loose
the latter from the sentence and fear of
condemnation. When we ascribe the power
of binding and loosing to that whole consistory,
wherein governing elders are joined
together with pastors, we mean only of the
keys of external discipline, which are used
in ecclesiastical courts and judicatories.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. When we teach that the pastor or
pastors of every particular church and congregation,
with the elders of the same,
being met together, have power to bind
and loose, we understand this only of such
places wherein a competent number of understanding
and qualified men may be had
to make up an eldership; otherwise let
there be one eldership made up of two or
three of the next adjacent parishes, according
as was ordained by the Church of Scotland,
in the 7th chapter of the Second Book
of Discipline. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sine totius</span></span> &amp;c.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Without
the consent of some whole church (saith
Zanchius<a id="noteref_1095" name="noteref_1095" href="#note_1095"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1095</span></span></a>) no man ought to be excommunicate.
Yea, I add, if it be a small church,
and not consisting of many learned and
skilful men, excommunication ought not to
be done, except the neighbour churches be
asked counsel of.”</span> And, as touching the
pastor's part, Calvin saith well, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nunquam</span></span>,
&amp;c.:<a id="noteref_1096" name="noteref_1096" href="#note_1096"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1096</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“I never thought it expedient the
liberty of excommunicating should be permitted
to every pastor.”</span> The fear of great
inconveniences, which he thought likely to
follow upon such a custom, if once it were
permitted, makes him confess, in that epistle,
that he durst not advise Liserus to excommunicate
any man without taking counsel
of other pastors. Now, I much marvel
what butt Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_1097" name="noteref_1097" href="#note_1097"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1097</span></span></a> shot at when he
entitleth one of his chapters <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Potestate
Excommunicandi</span></span>, and then, in the body of
the chapter, doth no more at all but only
quote those two testimonies of Zanchius
and Calvin; both of which do utterly condemn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-359">[pg 1-359]</span><a name="Pg1-359" id="Pg1-359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the usurpation of bishops who appropriate
to themselves the power of excommunication,
and ascribe this power to the consistory
of pastors and elders in every particular
church; and, in the forequoted places,
do only (for preventing of abuses) set some
bounds to the execution of their power;
which bounds we also think good to be kept,
viz., that if a church be so small that it
hath not so many well-qualified men as may
be sufficient to assist the pastor in the government
thereof, then let one common
eldership be made up out of it and some
other neighbour churches: by which means
it shall moreover come to pass (which is
the other caution to be given), that not
every pastor (no not with the elders of his
congregation) shall be permitted to have
full liberty of binding and loosing, but shall,
in those matters, receive counsel and advice
from other pastors. Howbeit, for this latter
purpose, the church of Scotland hath
profitably provided another remedy also,
namely, that, in certain chief places, all the
pastors in the adjacent bounds shall, at set
and ordinary times, assemble themselves
(which assemblies, in this nation, we call
presbyteries), that so the churches may be
governed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">communi presbyterorum consilio</span></span>,
as Jerome speaketh of the primitive times
of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Though the execution of the discipline
of excommunication and absolution
pertain to the consistory of the pastor and
elders in every church, yet this discipline
is to be by them executed in name of the
whole church.<a id="noteref_1098" name="noteref_1098" href="#note_1098"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1098</span></span></a> Saravia is bold to affirm,<a id="noteref_1099" name="noteref_1099" href="#note_1099"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1099</span></span></a>
that he who receiveth a sinner, or casteth
him out of the church, doeth this in the
name and authority of God alone. We
have proven, by strong arguments, that the
authority of excommunication pertaineth to
the whole church; which, though he contradicteth,
yet, in one place,<a id="noteref_1100" name="noteref_1100" href="#note_1100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1100</span></span></a> forgetting
himself, he acknowledges that the authority
of the church of Corinth was to intervene
in the excommunication of the incestuous
man. Wherefore, as in the name of
God, so in the name and authority of the
whole church, must one be cast out or received.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. To the right execution of this discipline
the manifest consent of the whole
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-360">[pg 1-360]</span><a name="Pg1-360" id="Pg1-360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
church is also necessary:<a id="noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101" href="#note_1101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a> the truth whereof,
beside that it appeareth from that which
hath been said concerning the church's authority,
it is further confirmed, if we consider
either the importance of the thing, or
the good of the person. Touching the importance
of the thing, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gravissima</span></span>, &amp;c.:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Most weighty matters in the church,”</span>
saith Gerhard,<a id="noteref_1102" name="noteref_1102" href="#note_1102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1102</span></span></a> and the same saith Zanchius
also,<a id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103" href="#note_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“ought
not to be undertaken without
the consent of the whole ecclesiastical
body;”</span> and, as Pope Leo writeth, <span class="tei tei-q">“Such
things as pertain unto all ought to be done
with the consent of all. But what can be
more weighty, and what doth more pertain
to the body of the church, than to cut off
some member from the body?”</span> And,
touching the good of the person, Augustine
showeth<a id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104" href="#note_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1104</span></span></a> that then only a sinner is both
stricken with fear and healed with shame,
when, seeing himself anathematised by the
whole church, he cannot find a fellow multitude
together wherewith he may rejoice in
his sin and insult upon good men. And
that otherwise, if the tares grow so rank
that they cannot be pulled up, and if the
same evil disease take hold of so very many
that the consent of the church cannot be
had to the excommunication of a wicked
person, then good men must grieve and
groan, and endure what they cannot help.
Therefore that excommunication may fruitfully
succeed, the consent of the people is
necessary: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frustra enim ejicitur ex ecclesia,
et consortio fidelium privatur, quem
populus, abigere, et a quo abstinere recuset.</span></span><a id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105" href="#note_1105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a>
Howbeit, even in such cases, when
the consent of the church cannot be had to
the execution of this discipline, faithful pastors
and professors must, every one for his
own part, take heed that he have no fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness,
but even reprove them; yea, they ought, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in.
sensu negativo</span></span>, excommunicate those who
should be (but are not) excommunicate positively,
which negative excommunication is
not an ecclesiastical censure, but either a
bare punishment, or a cautel and animadversion;
and so saith the Archbishop of
Spalato,<a id="noteref_1106" name="noteref_1106" href="#note_1106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1106</span></span></a>
not only one brother may refuse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-361">[pg 1-361]</span><a name="Pg1-361" id="Pg1-361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to communicate with another, but a people,
also, may refuse to communicate with their
pastor, which he confirmeth by certain examples.
But the public censure of positive
excommunication should not be inflicted
without the church's consent, for the reasons
foresaid. Cyprian writeth to Cornelius,
bishop of Rome, that he had much
laboured with the people that peace might
be given to them who had fallen; that is,
that they might be again received into the
communion of the church; which, if he
might have done by himself, why did he
labour and deal so much with the people in
that business? And as they were not received
into the church's communion without
the people's consent, so neither were
they without their consent excommunicate.
Chrysostom showeth,<a id="noteref_1107" name="noteref_1107" href="#note_1107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1107</span></span></a> concerning his time,
that when one was to be excommunicate,
the whole church was humbled in prayer
to God for him; and, when he was again
released, they did all kindly salute him,
and wish him peace. Tertullian also writeth,<a id="noteref_1108" name="noteref_1108" href="#note_1108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a>
that he who was to be excommunicate
in the public assembly of the church, was,
by the common consent of all, stricken with
judgment, and that all the approven and
well-liked elders had the precedence or direction
of the rest of the church in these matters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, from all this which hath been said
of the power and authority to excommunicate
and absolve, it is manifest how unjustly
usurping prelates do arrogate and appropriate
to themselves this power, which Christ
hath committed to every particular church
or congregation, and ordained to be execute
by the ecclesiastical consistory within
the same. Which episcopal usurpation, as
it hath been showed to be most contrary to
divine institution, so doth it also depart
from the manner of the ancient church:
for it may be seen, in Cyprian,<a id="noteref_1109" name="noteref_1109" href="#note_1109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1109</span></span></a> that the
authority of reconciling and receiving into
the church such as had fallen, was not proper
to the bishop, but, with him, common
to his clergy and presbytery, and that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus
communicationis</span></span> was given them by the
clergy as well as by the bishop. We have
heard, out of Jerome,<a id="noteref_1110" name="noteref_1110" href="#note_1110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1110</span></span></a> that a bishop did
nothing which a presbyter did not also, except
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-362">[pg 1-362]</span><a name="Pg1-362" id="Pg1-362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only that he gave rite or sign of ordination,
that is, imposition of hands. Whereby
we understand that as all other things,
beside ordination, so the power of excommunication,
among the rest, was alike common
to bishops and presbyters. Whence it
is, that the same Jerome, writing to Demetriades,
calleth excommunication <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Episcoporum
et Presbyterorum censura</span></span>. And
elsewhere, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alligat vel solvit Episcopus et
Presbyter.</span></span><a id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111" href="#note_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a> Justinian (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Novel</span></span>. 123, cap. 11)
saith, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Omnibus autem Episcopis et Presbyteris
interdicimus segregare aliquem a
sacra communione, antequam causa monstretur</span></span>,
&amp;c., certifying them, if they do
otherwise, that he whom they excommunicate
should be loosed from excommunication
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a majore sacerdota</span></span>. Whence we see, that
presbyters also were wont to excommunicate,
and that this power was common to
them with the bishops. The First Council
of Carthage, can. 23, decreeth that a bishop
hear no man's cause without the presence
of his clergy; and that otherwise his sentence
shall be void, except it be confirmed
by the presence of his clergy. The
canon law itself hath some vestiges of
the ancient order: it ordaineth,<a id="noteref_1112" name="noteref_1112" href="#note_1112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1112</span></span></a> that when
a bishop either excommunicateth or absolveth
any man, twelve of the clergy be
present, and concur with him. Dr Forbesse
now also acknowledgeth,<a id="noteref_1113" name="noteref_1113" href="#note_1113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1113</span></span></a> that it is
not lawful for a bishop to exercise the
power of public jurisdiction by himself, and
without the presbytery; and, under this
power of jurisdiction, whereof he speaketh,<a id="noteref_1114" name="noteref_1114" href="#note_1114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1114</span></span></a>
he comprehendeth the visitation of
churches, ordination, suspension, and deposition
of ministers, the excommunicating of
contumacious persons, and the reconciling
of them when they become penitent, the
calling of the fellow-presbyters to a synod,
the making of ecclesiastical canons, &amp;c.;
which power of jurisdiction, saith he,<a id="noteref_1115" name="noteref_1115" href="#note_1115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1115</span></span></a> remaineth
one and the same, whole and entire,
both in the bishop, and in the presbytery:
in him personally; in it collegially.
His confession of the presbytery's power
and authority, we catch and lay hold on;
but whereas he would have this power any
way proper and personal to bishops, he is
confuted by our former arguments.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And thus far have we demonstrated to
princes, who be they to whom Christ hath
committed the power of excommunication,
that with them they may cause it to remain,
and correct the usurpation of prelates,
who bereave them of it. Let us
next consider what princes may, or should
do, after that the sentence of any man's
excommunication or reconciliation is given
forth by them to whom the power of this
discipline pertaineth. The Archbishop of
Spalato is of opinion,<a id="noteref_1116" name="noteref_1116" href="#note_1116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1116</span></span></a> that not only it is
free to princes to communicate with excommunicate
persons, but also, that if they shall
happen to communicate with them, the
church (for the reverence she oweth to
princes) should straight absolve them, and
that her sentence of excommunication should
no longer have any strength. What! Shall
the church draw and put up again the spiritual
sword at the pleasure of princes? Or
because princes will perhaps cast holy things
to dogs, must others do so likewise? O prodigious
licentiousness, and hellish misorder,
worthy to be drowned in the lake of Lethe!
But what, then, is the part of the prince,
after that the church hath given judgment?
Surely, whensoever need is, he ought, by
the private judgment of Christian discretion,
to try and examine whether this discipline
be rightly executed or not. If he
find the execution thereof to be unreprovable,
and that yet the sinner goeth on in
his contumacy, then, by his civil power,<a id="noteref_1117" name="noteref_1117" href="#note_1117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1117</span></span></a> he
ought further to punish him in his person
or worldly estate, that he may either reform
or repress such an one as hath not been
terrified by the church's censures. But if,
after trial, he understand that the sentence
given forth is unjust and erroneous, either
through the ignorance or the malice of the
ecclesiastical and regular judges, then he
ought to interpone his authority, and cause
a due proceeding; for, in such extraordinary
cases of the failing of ecclesiastical persons,
princes may do much in things spiritual,
which, ordinarily, they cannot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remaineth to show who have the power
of those censures and punishments which
are proper to ecclesiastical persons. Where,
first, we are to consider, that there are two
sorts of faults which make ecclesiastical men
worthy to be punished, viz., either such as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-364">[pg 1-364]</span><a name="Pg1-364" id="Pg1-364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
violate sacred, or such as violate civil and
human duties: the one is to be judged by
ecclesiastical judges alone, and that according
to the laws of God and the church; the
other by civil judges alone, and that according
to the civil and municipal laws of
the commonwealth. This latter form, again,
is twofold; for either the fault is such, that,
though a man be condignly punished for it
by the civil magistrate, yet he doth not,
therefore, fall from his ecclesiastical office
or dignity; of which sort experience showeth
many; or else such as being punished
according to their quality and demerit, a
man, by necessary consequence, falleth from
the ecclesiastical function and dignity which
before he had: this was Abiathar's case,
and the case of so many as, being justly
punished by proscription, incarceration, or
banishment, are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">secundario et ex consequenti</span></span>
shut from their bearing office in the
church. <span class="tei tei-q">“If Abiathar had sinned in a
sacred matter, the cognition thereof (saith
Junius<a id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118" href="#note_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a>) had pertained to the priests; but
because he sinned against the commonwealth
and the king's majesty, it was necessary to
deal with him civilly, and not ecclesiastically.
What! Are no ecclesiastical men in
this time also thought to be lawfully judged
by the civil magistrate, if, at any time, they
be found guilty of appaired majesty?”</span> As
for the other sorts of faults, whereby (as we
have said) sacred and ecclesiastical duties
are violate, such as the teaching of false
and heretical doctrine, neglecting of discipline,
unbeseeming and scandalous conversation,
&amp;c. which things (if they be not
mended) they who have the execution of
ecclesiastical jurisdiction committed to them
ought to punish by suspension, deposition,
&amp;c. Now, as when one is called to the
work of the ministry, his fitness and qualification
for that work should be tried and
judged by the clergy of the adjacent bounds
assembled in their classical presbytery, to
whom it also appertaineth (after that he is
by them tried and approved, and after that
he is elected by the church where he is to
serve) to send him out from them with
power to exercise the office of a pastor; so
when there is just cause of suspending and
depriving him, it belongeth to the same
presbytery to consider and judge hereof;
and, according to his offence, to give judgment
against him. For who should recal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-365">[pg 1-365]</span><a name="Pg1-365" id="Pg1-365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him but they that sent him? Or who
should discharge him his ministerial function,
except they who ordained him to
exercise the same? And who may take
the power from him but they who gave the
power unto him? That ordination pertaineth
to the whole presbytery, and not to
the bishop alone, we have showed before,
and now, by the same reason, we say suspension
and deposition pertaineth to the
presbytery also, and are not in the power
of the bishop. And that, in the ancient
church, as bishops gave not ordination, so
neither did they suspend nor depose any
man without the common counsel, advice,
and concurrence of the presbytery, yea,
and sometimes of a synod, it is clear from
Cypr. (lib. 1, epist. 9; lib. 3, epist. 2, 10),
Council Carthag. 3 (can. 8), Council Carthag.
4 (can. 22, 23), Council African.
(can. 20), Council Hispan. 2 (can. 6), Justin.
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Novel</span></span>. 42, cap. 1), Jerome (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comment.
ad Isa</span></span> 3), Siricius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist ad Ambros.
inter Ambr. Epist.</span></span>) So, touching the suspension
and deposition of ministers, the
Assembly at Glasgow, anno 1610, ordained
that the bishop should associate to himself
the ministry of those bounds where the delinquent
served, that is, the presbytery
whereof he hath been a member, and, together
with them, there take trial of the
fact, and, upon just cause found, to deprive
or suspend: which Act was ratified in the
12th parliament of king James, anno 1612.
Nevertheless, if any man think the sentence
of the bishop and the presbytery, given
forth against him, to be unjust, he ought
to have liberty of recourse to the synod,
and there to be heard, according as it was
decreed by the Fourth Council of Carthage,
can. 66. But oftimes the matter
is of such difficulty or importance that the
bishop and the presbytery may not give
out any peremptory sentence of suspension
or deprivation till the matter be brought
to the synod of the province,<a id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119" href="#note_1119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1119</span></span></a> where, according
to the ancient order, the matter is
to be handled,<a id="noteref_1120" name="noteref_1120" href="#note_1120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1120</span></span></a> not <span class="tei tei-q">“by the censure of one
bishop, but by the judgment of the whole
clergy gathered together.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Princes, therefore, may not suffer bishops
to usurp the power of suspending and depriving
at their pleasure, and whensoever
they commit any such tyranny in smiting of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-366">[pg 1-366]</span><a name="Pg1-366" id="Pg1-366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their fellow-servants, it is the part of princes
to cause these things to be redressed, and
for this end graciously to receive the grievances
of oppressed ministers. The Arians
of old, being assembled in a council at
Antioch, decreed, that if any ecclesiastical
person should, without the advice and
the letters of the bishops<a id="noteref_1121" name="noteref_1121" href="#note_1121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1121</span></span></a> of the province,
and chiefly of the metropolitan, go
to the emperor to put up any grievance
unto him, he should be cast out, not only
from the holy communion, but from his proper
dignity which he had in the church.
Whereupon Osiander hath this observation:<a id="noteref_1122" name="noteref_1122" href="#note_1122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“This canon also was composed against holy
Athanasius; for Athanasius being expelled
by the Arians, had fled to the emperor
Constantine the younger, and had from him
obtained a return to his own church. Now
this canon is very unjust, which forbids that
a bishop, or any other minister of the church,
being unjustly oppressed, flee to his godly
civil magistrate; since it was lawful to the
apostle Paul to appeal to the Roman emperor
wicked Nero, as the Acts of the Apostles
witness. But it may be seen in this
place, that bishops were very soon seeking
dominion, yea, tyranny over the church,
and over their colleges.”</span> Besides all this,
there is yet another thing which ought to
have a very principal consideration in the
deposition of a minister, and that is, the
consent of the church and congregation
where he hath served. Let the magistrate
know, saith Gerhard,<a id="noteref_1123" name="noteref_1123" href="#note_1123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1123</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that as the vocation
of ministers pertaineth to the whole
church, so to the same also pertaineth the
removing of ministers; therefore, as a minister
ought not to be obtruded upon an unwilling
church, so the hearers, being unwilling
and striving against it, a fit minister ought
not to be plucked away from them.”</span> The
deposing of a minister, whom the church
loves and willingly hears, Balduine accounteth
to be high sacrilege,<a id="noteref_1124" name="noteref_1124" href="#note_1124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1124</span></span></a> and holdeth that,
as the calling, so the dismissing of ministers
pertaineth to the whole church; and so
teacheth Junius.<a id="noteref_1125" name="noteref_1125" href="#note_1125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1125</span></span></a> Shortly, as a man is
rightly called to the ministerial office and
dignity when he is elected by the church
and ordained by the presbytery, so is he
rightly deposed and put from the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-367">[pg 1-367]</span><a name="Pg1-367" id="Pg1-367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when he is rejected by the church and discharged
by the presbytery.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How there was brought forth in Scotland,
anno 1610, a certain amphibian brood,
sprung out of the stem of Neronian tyranny,
and in manners like to his nearest kinsman,
the Spanish Inquisition. It is armed
with a transcendant power, and called by
the dreadful name of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">High Commission</span></span>.
Among other things, it arrogateth
to itself the power of deposing ministers;
but how unjustly, thus it appeareth:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. If those commissioners have any power
at all to depose ministers, they have it from
the king, whose commissioners they are:
but from him they have it not; therefore
they have none at all. The proposition
is most certain; for they sit not in
that commission to judge in their own
name, nor by their own authority, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quum
nihil exerceat delegatus nomine proprio</span></span>,
as Panormitan saith,<a id="noteref_1126" name="noteref_1126" href="#note_1126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1126</span></span></a>) but by virtue only of
the commission and delegation which they
have of the king. Yea, bishops themselves
exercise not any jurisdiction in the High
Commission as bishops, but only as the
king's commissioners, as Dr Downame acknowledgeth.<a id="noteref_1127" name="noteref_1127" href="#note_1127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1127</span></span></a>
The assumption is grounded
upon this reason: The king hath not
power to depose ministers; therefore he
cannot give this power to others. For
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nemo potest plus juris transferre in
alium quam sibi competere dignoscatur</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1128" name="noteref_1128" href="#note_1128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1128</span></span></a>
the king may sometimes inflict such a civil
punishment upon ministers, whereupon, secondarily
and accidentally, will follow their
falling away from their ecclesiastical office
and function (in which sense it is said that
Solomon deposed Abiathar, as we heard before),
but to depose them directly and formally
(which the High Commission usurped
to do) he hath no power, and that because
this deposition is an act of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction; whereas the power of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction doth no more agree to
the king than the power of ecclesiastical
order: his power is civil and temporal, not
spiritual and ecclesiastical. Dr Field also
confesseth,<a id="noteref_1129" name="noteref_1129" href="#note_1129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1129</span></span></a> that none may judicially degrade,
or put any one, lawfully admitted,
from his degree and order, but the spiritual
guides of the church alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The deposing of ministers pertaineth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-368">[pg 1-368]</span><a name="Pg1-368" id="Pg1-368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to classical presbyteries, or (if the matter
be doubtful and difficult) to synods, as hath
been showed. And who, then, can give
the High Commission such authority as to
take this power from them and assume it
unto itself. These commissioners profess
that they have authority to discharge other
ecclesiastical judicatories within the kingdom
from meddling with the judging of
anything which they shall think impertinent
for them, and which they shall think
good to judge and decide by themselves in
their commission: which, if it be so, then,
when it pleaseth them, they may make
other ecclesiastical judicatories to be altogether
useless and of no effect in the
church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. In this commission ecclesiastical and
temporal men are joined together, and both
armed with the same power; therefore it is
not right nor regular, nor in any ways allowable.
For even, as when a minister
hath offended in a civil matter, his fault
is to be judged by civil judges according to
the civil laws, and by no other; so, when he
offendeth in an ecclesiastical matter, his
fault is to be judged only by ecclesiastical
persons according to ecclesiastical laws; and,
in such case, Justinian forbiddeth<a id="noteref_1130" name="noteref_1130" href="#note_1130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1130</span></span></a> civil men
to be joined with ecclesiastical men in judgment.
They are ecclesiastical things or
causes which are handled and examined by
the High Commission in the process of deposing
ministers; and a shame it is to ecclesiastical
men, if they cannot, without the
help and joining of temporal men, judge
and decide things of this quality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. As in the matters to be judged, so in
the censures and punishments to be inflicted,
ecclesiastical and civil men have, in this
commission, alike power and authority; for
ecclesiastical men therein have power of
fining, confining, warding, &amp;c., common to
them with the temporal men; and, again,
the temporal men have power of excommunication,
suspension, deprivation, &amp;c., common
to them with the ecclesiastical men.
For they all sit there as the king's commissioners,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eo nomine</span></span>, they exercise this
jurisdiction; which commission being alike
discharged by them all, it is manifest that
both temporal men take hold of the keys
and ecclesiastical men take hold of the civil
sword. And this monstrous confusion and
mixture giveth sufficient demonstration that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-369">[pg 1-369]</span><a name="Pg1-369" id="Pg1-369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such a form of judgment is not from the
God of order.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. And, first, we must understand
aright what is meant by the law of nature:
to wit, that law which God writeth and imprinteth
in the nature of man,<a id="noteref_1133" name="noteref_1133" href="#note_1133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1133</span></span></a> so that it
is as it were co-natural and born together
with man. Now, if we consider what law
was written in the nature of man in his
first creation, it was no other than the decalogue,
or the moral law.<a id="noteref_1134" name="noteref_1134" href="#note_1134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1134</span></span></a> But the law
which we are here to inquire of is that law
which, after the fall, God still writeth in
the heart of every man; which (we all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-370">[pg 1-370]</span><a name="Pg1-370" id="Pg1-370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
know) cometh far short, and wanteth much
of that which was written in the heart of
man before his fall. That we may understand
what this law of nature is which is
written in all men's hearts since the fall, we
must distinguish <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus naturale</span></span> from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum

simply called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus naturale</span></span> is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">innatum</span></span>, and
layeth before the minds of men that way
wherein, by the guidance and conduct of

they may be led to that good
which is, in the end, proportionate to nature;
whereas <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span> is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inspiratum</span></span>,
and layeth before us another way, wherein,

to a supernatural good, which is an end exceeding
the proportion of nature. As for
that part of the law of God which is called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum naturale</span></span>, it is so called in opposition

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. For my part, I take the law of
nature and the law of nations to be one
and the same. For what is the law of nations
but that which nature's light and
reason hath taught so to all nations? Now
this is no other than the law of nature. We
think, therefore, they have well said,<a id="noteref_1145" name="noteref_1145" href="#note_1145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1145</span></span></a> who
comprehend under the law of nature both
the common principles of good and evil, virtue
and vice, right and wrong, things beseeming
and things not beseeming, and likewise
the general conclusions which, by necessary
consequences, are drawn from the
said principles. To come to the particulars,
there are three sort of things which
the law of nature requireth of man, as both
schoolmen<a id="noteref_1146" name="noteref_1146" href="#note_1146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1146</span></span></a> and modern doctors<a id="noteref_1147" name="noteref_1147" href="#note_1147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1147</span></span></a> have rightly
taught. The first, it requireth as he is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ens</span></span>; the second, as he is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animal</span></span>; and the
third, as he is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">homo ratione præditus</span></span>.
First, As he is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ens</span></span>, the law of nature requireth
him to seek the conservation of his
own being, and to shun or repel such things
as may destroy the same. For so hath nature
framed not only all living creatures,
but other things also which are without life,
that they seek their own conservation, and
flee (if they can) from apparent destruction.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-372">[pg 1-372]</span><a name="Pg1-372" id="Pg1-372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Let us take one example out of subtle Scalliger,<a id="noteref_1148" name="noteref_1148" href="#note_1148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1148</span></span></a>
which is this: If a small quantity of
oil be poured upon a sound board, let a
burning coal be put in the midst of it, and
the oil will quickly flee back from its enemy,
and seek the conservation of itself.
This is, therefore, the first precept of the
law of nature, that man seek his own conservation,
and avoid his own destruction.
Whereupon this conclusion necessarily followeth,
that he may repel violence with violence.
Secondly, As man is a living creature,
the law of nature teacheth him to
propagate and conserve his kind. Whereupon
these conclusions do follow, viz., the
commixion of male and female, the procreation
of children, the educating of them,
and providing for them. This nature hath
taught to man, as a thing common to him
with other living creatures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. Thirdly, As a man is a creature
endowed with reason, the law of nature
teacheth him, 1. Something concerning
God; 2. Something concerning his neighbour;
3. Something concerning himself. I
mean some general notions concerning good
and evil, in respect of each of these; whereof
the Apostle meaneth whilst he saith that
the Gentiles <span class="tei tei-q">“show the work of the law
written in their hearts,”</span> Rom. ii. 15. First,
then, the law of nature teacheth man to
know that there is a God, and that this
God is to be worshipped; whereupon it
followeth that man should seek to know
God and the manner of his worship. Now
that which may be known of God is showed
even unto the Gentiles. The Apostle saith
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">signanter</span></span>, το λυωστὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, Rom. i. 19,
meaning those few and small sparkles of
the knowledge of God which nature's inbred
light discovered unto the Gentiles,
for making them inexcusable, namely, that
there is an eternal power and Godhead,
which men ought to reverence and to worship.
2. The law of nature teacheth man
to hold fast friendship and amity with his
neighbours, forasmuch as he is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animal sociale.
Violare alterum</span></span>, saith Cicero, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">naturae
legae prohibemur</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1149" name="noteref_1149" href="#note_1149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1149</span></span></a> For the law of
nature biddeth us do to others as we would
have others to do unto us, Luke vi. 31.
And from these precepts it followeth, that
we should not offend other men; that we
should keep promises; stand to bargains;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-373">[pg 1-373]</span><a name="Pg1-373" id="Pg1-373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
give to every man his own, &amp;c. 3. As
touching a man's self, the law of nature
teacheth him that he should not live as a
reasonless creature, but that all his actions
should be such as may be congruous and
beseeming for a creature endued with reason:
Whereupon it followeth, that he
should live honestly and virtuously, that
he should observe order and decency in
all his actions, &amp;c. Hence the Apostle
saith, that nature itself teacheth that it
is a shame for a man to have long hair,
1 Cor. xi. 14, because it is repugnant to
that decency and comeliness which the law
of nature requireth. For, among other
differences<a id="noteref_1150" name="noteref_1150" href="#note_1150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1150</span></span></a> which nature hath put betwixt
men and women, this is one, that it hath
given to women thicker and longer hair
than to men, that it might be as a veil,
to adorn and cover them. The reason
whereof nature hath hid in the complexion
of a woman, which is more humid than
the complexion of a man; so that, if a
man should take him to this womanish
ornament, he should but against nature
transform himself (in so far) into a woman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. These things being permitted,
I will add four reasons to prove that neither
sacred significant ceremonies in general,
nor kneeling, holidays, &amp;c., in particular,
can be warranted unto us by the
law of nature. 1. The law of nature cannot
direct us unto a supernatural end, as
is acknowledged not only by our divines,<a id="noteref_1151" name="noteref_1151" href="#note_1151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1151</span></span></a>
but by Aquinas also.<a id="noteref_1152" name="noteref_1152" href="#note_1152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1152</span></span></a> It only teacheth us
to seek and to do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum, velut finem
naturæ</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1153" name="noteref_1153" href="#note_1153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1153</span></span></a> such a good as is an end proportioned
to nature. All these precepts
of the law of nature which we have spoken
of could never lead men to a supernatural
good. It is only the divine law,<a id="noteref_1154" name="noteref_1154" href="#note_1154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1154</span></span></a> revealed
from God, which informeth the minds of
men with such notions as are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supra naturam</span></span>,
and which may guide them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad finem
supernaturalem</span></span>. But all sacred significant
ceremonies which, by their holy and
spiritual significations, express to us some
mysteries of grace, and of the kingdom of
God, must be thought to direct us unto a
supernatural good; therefore they are not of
that sort of things which the law of nature
requireth; for this law goeth no higher than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-374">[pg 1-374]</span><a name="Pg1-374" id="Pg1-374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to teach men that there is a God, and that
this God is to be worshipped, the knowledge
of which things is not a good exceeding the
proportion of nature: for it was found in the
Gentiles themselves, who knew no other spiritual
and supernatural good than that which
was proportioned to nature. Let me now
conclude this reason with Scalliger's words,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Neque enim quae supra naturae leges sunt,
ex naturae legibus judicanda censeo</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1155" name="noteref_1155" href="#note_1155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1155</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. 2. As the ceremonies, by their
sacred, spiritual, and mystical significations,
direct us unto a supernatural good, so they
are thought to guide us unto the same by a
way which nature's light could never discover
unto men. But, in the law of nature,
as we are directed unto no other good
than such as is proportioned to nature, so
are we guided unto the same <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">natura
duce</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1156" name="noteref_1156" href="#note_1156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1156</span></span></a>
that is to say, by such common notions as
God hath imprinted in the nature of all
men. Now, I suppose our opposites will
not unwillingly reckon their sacred significant
ceremonies among those things of the
Spirit of God which a natural man cannot
receive, because they are spiritually decerned,
1 Cor. ii. 14. What then have they
to do with the law of nature? If it be said,
that they necessarily follow upon those first
principles and conclusions which a natural
man receiveth, I answer, This shall never
be proved. They will say, perhaps, that
nature teacheth us to use certain rites in
the worship of God, to observe set times for
his worship, also to kneel down in reverence
of God whom we worship. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Be it so:
but how make they up a necessary connection
betwixt certain rites and significant ceremonies
of human institution; betwixt set
times, and some more days than one of
seven; betwixt kneeling in the worship of
God <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in genere</span></span>, and kneeling at the sacrament
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in specie</span></span>, unless they say that nature
requireth us to kneel in every act of worship,
and never to worship God without
kneeling on our knees?

the law of nature <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fixa est cordibus nostris</span></span>,
as Stella:<a id="noteref_1161" name="noteref_1161" href="#note_1161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1161</span></span></a> yea, it is <span class="tei tei-q">“so written in our

from the Apostle, that the law of nature
is manifest in the Gentiles, for God
hath showed it unto them, Rom. i. 19;
therefore there is none ignorant, saith
Pareus.<a id="noteref_1163" name="noteref_1163" href="#note_1163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1163</span></span></a>
Whatsoever, then, the law of nature
requireth, it doth clearly and necessarily
follow upon those principles which
are written in every man's conscience, unless
we set up new divinity, and either say
that the principles of the law of nature are
not written in every man's conscience, or
else that they may be at some time abolished
and rased out of the consciences of
men; which were to leave men without a
witness. Nay, saith Augustine,<a id="noteref_1164" name="noteref_1164" href="#note_1164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1164</span></span></a> the heaven
and the earth, and all that is in them,
on every side, cease not to bid all men love
God, that they be made inexcusable. Now
if all the principles of the law of nature be
firmly and clearly written in every man's
conscience, and cannot but be known to
every man who has the use of natural
judgment and reason, it followeth, that
they who will prove or warrant anything
by the law of nature, must only take their
premises from every man's conscience, and
say, as the Apostle saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Judge in yourselves,”</span>
&amp;c., <span class="tei tei-q">“doth not even nature itself
teach you,”</span> &amp;c., 1 Cor. xi. 13, 14; as if the
Apostle said, This principle of nature is
fixed in all your hearts, that men should
affect honesty and comeliness. Go to reason
in yourselves, from the judgment of
nature, whether it follow not, upon this
principle, that a man should not wear long
hair, forasmuch as his wearing of long hair
is repugnant to the principle of nature.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Committit ipsis judicium</span></span>, saith Pareus;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ipsos testes, imo judices

so that, if the ceremonies be warranted unto us by
the law of nature, the judgment must be
committed to every man's conscience, and
so should every man be convinced in himself,
by such a principle of nature, from
which the ceremonies have a necessary and
manifest deduction. Yet we attest the
Searcher of all hearts, that we have never
been convinced in ourselves, by such a principle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-376">[pg 1-376]</span><a name="Pg1-376" id="Pg1-376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of nature, no, not after diligent search
and inquiry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 9. 4. Let our opposites say to
us, once for all, upon what precept of the
law of nature do they ground the ceremonies;
for I have before opened up all sorts
of things which the law of nature requireth
of man as he is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ens</span></span>; and as he is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animal</span></span>
belongeth not to our purpose. As for that
which it requireth of him as he is a creature
endued with reason, there is one part
of it that concerneth ourselves, viz., that we
should live honestly, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">secundum modum
rationis</span></span>, that we should observe order and
decency in all our actions. This order and
decency do not respect our holy duties to
God, nor comprehend any sacred ceremony
in his worship; but they look to usward,
and are referred only to such beseeming
qualities as are congruous and convenient
to a reasonable nature in all its actions.
Yea, even generally, we may say
with Scalliger,<a id="noteref_1166" name="noteref_1166" href="#note_1166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1166</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ordinem dico sine quo natura
constare non potest. Nihil enim
absque ordine vel med tata est vel effecit
illa.</span></span> Another part of that which nature
requireth of man, as he is a creature endued
with reason, concerneth (as we showed)
our neighbours, whom it teacheth us
not to harm nor offend, &amp;c. And if our
opposites would reckon with us here, their
ceremonies will appear repugnant to nature,
because of the detriment and offence
which they offer unto us, whereof we have
spoken in our argument of scandal. But
there was a third part, concerning God and
his worship; and here must our opposites
seek a warrant for the ceremonies. Now,
albeit nature (as was said) teaches all men
that there is an eternal and mighty God,
who should be worshipped and honoured by
them, yet it descendeth not unto such particular
precepts as can have any show of
making aught for significant ceremonies.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Omnibus enim innatum est et in animo
quasi insculptum, esse deos</span></span>; but yet
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quales sint</span></span>, saith Cicero,

And as nature hath not taught men to
know the nature and attributes of the Godhead,
together with the sacred Trinity of
persons in the same; so neither hath it
taught what sort or manner of worship
should be given unto God. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lex naturalis
rerum communium est</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1168" name="noteref_1168" href="#note_1168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1168</span></span></a> and doth only

requireth, either of any distinct kind of
worship or of any ceremony in that kind,
no more than it followeth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Si est animal,

to gain time against us: this indifferency, I
mean, which they shall never make out,
and which themselves, otherwhiles, unweave
again. Always, so long as they think to
get any place for higher notions about the
ceremonies, they speak not so meanly of
them as of things indifferent; but when all
their forces of arguments and answers are
spent in vain, then are our ears filled with
uncouth outcries and declamations, which
tend to make themselves appear blameless
for receiving, and us blameworthy for refusing
matters of rite and indifferency.

again, in books, in sermons, in private discourses.
Mr G. Powell (in his book <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
Adiaphoris</span></span>), and Tilen (in the 12th and
17th chapters of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paraenesis</span></span>), condemn
those who make aught ado about the controverted
English ceremonies, for so much
as they are things indifferent. Paybody, in
his Apology for kneeling at the communion,
standeth much upon the indifferency of this
gesture, both in every worship of God, and
in that sacrament namely. The Archbishop
of St. Andrews, in his sermon at Perth Assembly,
because he could not prove this indifferency,
he chose to suppose it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of
the indifferency of these articles (saith he) I
think there is little or no question amongst
us.”</span> Whether he spake this of ignorance
or of policy, I leave it to be guessed at.
Howsoever, if we should thus compose our
controversy about the ceremonies, embrace
them, and practise them, so being that they
be only called things indifferent, this were
to cure our church, as L. Sylla cured his
country, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">durioribus remediis quam pericula

betwixt good and evil in human actions, as

and yet susceptive of either of them. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Indifferens</span></span>,

But Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_1172" name="noteref_1172" href="#note_1172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1172</span></span></a> liketh to speak in another
language. He will have that which is
indifferent to be opponed to that which is
necessary; and a thing indifferent he taketh
to be such a thing as is neither necessarily
to be done, nor yet necessarily to be
omitted, in respect of any necessity of the
commandment of God; or such a thing as
is neither remunerable with eternal life, and
commendeth a man unto the reward of God,
nor yet is punishable with eternal death,
and polluteth a man with guiltiness. Now,
because he knew that divines define a thing
indifferent to be that which is neither good
nor evil, he therefore distinguisheth a twofold
goodness of an individual action.<a id="noteref_1173" name="noteref_1173" href="#note_1173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1173</span></span></a> The
one he calleth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonitas generalis, concomitans,
et sine qua non</span></span>; by which goodness
is meant the doing of an action in faith,
and the doing of it for the right end, as he
expoundeth himself. This goodness, he
saith, is necessary to every human action,
and hindereth not an action to be indifferent.
The other he calleth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonitas specialis,
causans, et propter quam</span></span>. This
goodness he calleth legal, and saith that it
maketh an action necessary; in which respect
indifferent actions are not good, but
those only which God in his law hath commanded,
and which are remunerable with
eternal life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. But that we may have the vanity
of these quiddities discovered to us, let
us only consider how falsely he supposeth
that there are some things which we do
neither laudably nor culpably, and for which
we shall neither be rewarded (it is his own
phrase which I use) nor yet punished by
God. I thought we had learned from Scripture
that we must all appear before the
judgment-seat of Christ, to give an account
of every word which we speak, and of every
deed which we do in the flesh, and accordingly
to receive either a reward or a punishment.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-381">[pg 1-381]</span><a name="Pg1-381" id="Pg1-381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
What! Could the Doctor say that
these good actions which he calleth indifferent,
and of which he saith that they are done
in faith, and for the right end, are not laudable
nor remunerable? Nay, but he saith<a id="noteref_1174" name="noteref_1174" href="#note_1174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1174</span></span></a>
that the general goodness which accompanieth
the action is remunerable, because it
is necessary, but the action itself is not necessary,
because that general goodness may
be had as well in the omission of it, or in
the doing of the contrary, as in the doing
of it, whereupon he would have it to follow
that the action itself is not remunerable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. The Doctor had done well to
have remembered that he is speaking only
of individual actions, and that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">actus individuatur
a circumstantus et adjecto modo</span></span>,
so that whilst all that he saith turneth to
this, that one action considered in itself,
without the circumstances and concomitant
goodness, is not remunerable, he maketh
not out his point; for he saith no more in
effect, but that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">actus quo ad speciem</span></span> is not
remunerable, which none of us denieth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. An individual good action of that
kind which the Doctor calleth necessary, is
no otherwise remunerable and laudable than
an individual good action of that kind which
he calleth indifferent, for example, when I
go to hear God's word upon the Lord's day,
let this action of mine be considered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad
individuum</span></span>, is it any otherwise remunerable
than in respect of the goodness which accompanieth
it? Whence it is that the hearing
of hypocrites, not being accompanied
with such goodness, is not remunerable, yet
the hearing of the word is an action necessary,
because commanded? Now may we
know wherein standeth the difference betwixt
the remunerable good of this action of
hearing, and remunerable good of one of
those actions which the Doctor calleth indifferent,
for example, a woman's action of
marrying.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I perceive what the Doctor would answer,
for he saith,<a id="noteref_1175" name="noteref_1175" href="#note_1175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1175</span></span></a> if a woman marry in
the Lord, this action is good <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectu adjecti
modi, quamvis in se sit media et libera,
etiam quo ad individuum</span></span>, implying
that if, on the other part, an individual action
be necessary (as for example the action
of hearing the word), then it is in itself
good, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">etiam quo ad individuum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, I reply, what means he by these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-382">[pg 1-382]</span><a name="Pg1-382" id="Pg1-382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
words, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in se</span></span>? Means he the individual nature
of the action? Nay, then the sense
shall be no other than this, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum,
etiam quo ad individuum</span></span>. And, besides,
the Doctor cannot define to us any
other nature in an individual thing than the
nature of the species or kind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is it not holden <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">individuum non posse
definiri, nisi definitione specici</span></span>?<a id="noteref_1176" name="noteref_1176" href="#note_1176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1176</span></span></a> Sure a
perfect definition, expressing the nature of
the thing defined, cannot be given to any
individual thing other than the definition of
the species, needs, therefore, must the Doctor,
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in se</span></span>, understand the specifical nature,
and, indeed, when divines speak of
things indifferent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in se</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sua
natura</span></span>, they mean only things indifferent
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad speciem</span></span>. Yet thus also the Doctor
hath said nonsense, for so we should take
his words, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quamvis quoad speciem sit media
et libera, etiam quo ad individuum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. But to let his manner of speaking
pass, we will consider what he would or
could have said. There is no difference
which can here be imagined except this:
That the individual action of hearing the
word (when one heareth aright) is good and
remunerable in a double respect, namely,
because it is both good in itself, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad
speciem</span></span>, and likewise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectu adjecti modi</span></span>,
whereas a woman's action of marrying
(when she marrieth in the Lord) is only
good and remunerable in the last respect,
namely, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectu modi</span></span>,
for, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in se</span></span>, or, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo
ad speciem</span></span>, it hath no remunerable goodness
in it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> What do we hear of any difference
betwixt these actions <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad speciem</span></span>? That
which we crave is, that a difference may be
showed betwixt the remunerable goodness of
the one and of the other, both being considered
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That whereby the Doctor either was deceived,
or would deceive, appeareth to be
this: That he taketh everything which
agreeth to an individual thing to agree to
it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>, as if to speak of Peter
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quatenus est homo</span></span>, and to speak of him
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quatenus est individuum signatum</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">res
singularis sub specie hominis</span></span>, were all one
thing. Even so, to say of my individual action
of hearing the word, that it is necessary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-383">[pg 1-383]</span><a name="Pg1-383" id="Pg1-383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
because of the commandment of God (and
in that respect remunerable), is not to speak
of it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>, but as the specifical
nature of that action of hearing the
word (which God hath commanded) is found
in it; for if we speak of this individual action,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>, we cannot consider
it otherwise than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectu adjecti modi</span></span>,
because, in moral actions, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">modus adjectus</span></span>
is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, and nothing
else doth individualise a moral action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. Thus shall my position stand good,
namely, that those individual actions which
the Doctor calleth necessary, because their
species is commanded of God, and those individual
actions which he calleth indifferent,
because their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span> is not commanded,
both being considered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>,
the former hath no other remunerable good
in them than the latter, and the whole remunerable
good which is in either of them
standeth only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in objecto modo</span></span>; which being
so, it is all one when we speak of any individual
moral action <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>,
whether we say that it is good, or that it is
remunerable and laudable, both are one. For,
as is well said by Aquinas,<a id="noteref_1177" name="noteref_1177" href="#note_1177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1177</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Necessarium
est omnem actum hominis, ut bonum vel
malum, culpabilis vel laudabilis rationem
habere</span></span>. And again: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil enim est aliud
laudari vel culpari, quam imputari alicui
malitiam vel bonitatem sui actus</span></span>; wherefore
that distinction of a twofold goodness,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">causans</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concomitans</span></span>, which the Doctor
hath given us, hath no use in this question,
because every action is laudable and
remunerable which is morally good, whether
it be necessary or not. Now moral goodness,
saith Scalliger,<a id="noteref_1178" name="noteref_1178" href="#note_1178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1178</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">est perfectio actus
cum recta ratione</span></span>. Human moral actions
are called good or evil, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in ordine ad rationem,
quae est proprium principium humanorum
actuum</span></span>, saith Aquinas,<a id="noteref_1179" name="noteref_1179" href="#note_1179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1179</span></span></a> thereupon
inferring that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">illis mores dicuntur
boni, qui rationi congruunt; mali autem,
qui à ratione discordant</span></span>. Dr Forbesse
doth therefore pervert the question whilst
he saith,<a id="noteref_1180" name="noteref_1180" href="#note_1180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1180</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in hac cum fratribus quaestione,
hoc bonum est quod necessarium</span></span>. Nay,
those actions we call morally good which
are agreeable to right reason, whether they
be necessary or not. Since, then, those
actions are laudable and remunerable which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-384">[pg 1-384]</span><a name="Pg1-384" id="Pg1-384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are morally good, and those are morally
good which are agreeable to right reason, it
followeth, that forasmuch as those actions
which the Doctor calleth indifferent, are
agreeable to right reason, they are, therefore,
not only morally good, but also laudable
and remunerable, and so not indifferent.
Yea, those actions which he calleth necessary,
being considered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>,
are no otherwise laudable and remunerable
than those which he calleth indifferent,
being considered in like manner <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad
individuum</span></span>, as hath been showed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. And besides all this, we have
somewhat more to say of the Doctor's speculation
about the nature of things indifferent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. The Doctor maketh that which
is indifferent to be opponed to that which is
necessary, and yet he maketh both these to
be morally good. Now albeit in natural
things one good is opponed to another good,
as that which is hot to that which is cold,
yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum bona non contrariatur
in moralibus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1181" name="noteref_1181" href="#note_1181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1181</span></span></a>
The reason of the difference is,
because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonitas physica</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">relativa est
congruentia naturae quaedem</span></span>, saith Scalliger;<a id="noteref_1182" name="noteref_1182" href="#note_1182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1182</span></span></a>
and because two natures may be contrary
one to another, therefore the good
which is congruous to the one may be contrary
to the good which is congruous to the
other; but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum virtutis</span></span>,
saith Aquinas<a id="noteref_1183" name="noteref_1183" href="#note_1183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1183</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non accipitur nisi per convenientiam ad
aliquid unum, scilicet rationem</span></span>; so that it
is impossible for one moral good to be opponed
to another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Since divines take a thing indifferent
to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">medium inter bonum et malum morale</span></span>;
and since (as the very notation of the
word showeth) it is such a means as cometh
not nearer to the one extreme than to the
other, but is alike distant from both, how
comes it that the Doctor so far departeth
both from the tenet of divines and from
the notation of the word, as to call some
such actions indifferent as have a moral remunerable
goodness, and yet not evil in
them? or where learned he such a dialect
as giveth to some good things the name of
the things indifferent?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Why doth he also waver from himself;
for he citeth<a id="noteref_1184" name="noteref_1184" href="#note_1184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1184</span></span></a> out of the Helvetic
Confessor Jerome's definition of a thing indifferent,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-385">[pg 1-385]</span><a name="Pg1-385" id="Pg1-385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and approveth it. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Indifferens</span></span>,
saith he, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">illud est quod nec bonum nec
malum est, ut sive feceris sive non feceris,
nec justitiam habeas nec injustitiam.</span></span> Behold
the goodness which is excluded from
the nature of a thing indifferent is not only
necessity but righteousness also, yet hath the
Doctor excluded only the good of necessity
from things indifferent, making the other
good of righteousness to stand with them;
for things which are done in faith, and done
for the right end (such as he acknowledgeth
these things to be which he calleth indifferent),
have righteousness in them, as all
men know.

When we measure the goodness or the badness

measure it by the object and the end, but

it. Fed. Morellus,<a id="noteref_1185" name="noteref_1185" href="#note_1185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1185</span></span></a> upon those words of

say the schoolmen,<a id="noteref_1187" name="noteref_1187" href="#note_1187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1187</span></span></a>

It is not every man's part, saith one of our
opposites,<a id="noteref_1188" name="noteref_1188" href="#note_1188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1188</span></span></a> to judge <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de circumstantia, quae
reddit actionem vel bonam vel malam</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Some circumstances, saith another of
them,<a id="noteref_1189" name="noteref_1189" href="#note_1189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1189</span></span></a> are intrinsical and essential to actions,
and specially making up their nature.”</span>
The principal circumstances which
here we speak of, are comprehended in this
versicle:—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur quomodo,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">quando.</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first circumstance which maketh an
action good or bad is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quis</span></span>, which designeth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-386">[pg 1-386]</span><a name="Pg1-386" id="Pg1-386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the person: If a magistrate put to
death a malefactor, the action is good; but
if a private person put him to death, it is
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quid</span></span>, which noteth the
quality or condition of the object: If a man
take <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sua</span></span>, the
action is good; if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aliena</span></span>, it is
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ubi</span></span>: If men banquet in
their own houses, the action is good; if in
the church, it is evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourth is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quibus auxiliis</span></span>: If men
seek health by lawful means, the action is
good; if by the devil, or his instruments, it
is evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fifth is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cur</span></span>: If I rebuke my brother
for his fault, out of my love to him,
and desire to reclaim him, the action is
good; if out of hatred and spleen, the action
is evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sixth is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quomodo</span></span>: For he who doth
the work of the Lord carefully doth well;
but he who doth it negligently doth evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seventh is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quando</span></span>: To do servile
work upon the six days of labour, is good;
but to do it upon the Lord's Sabbath, is
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. There is another consideration which
followeth upon the former; and it is this:
The goodness or badness of a human action
may be considered two ways, viz.,
either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu signato</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad speciem</span></span>;
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu exercito</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad
individuum</span></span>; for an action is said to be
specificated by its object, and individuated
by its circumstances; so that, when an action
is good or evil in respect of the object
of it, then it is called good or evil <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad
speciem</span></span>: when it is good or evil in respect
of the circumstances of it, then it is said to
be good or evil <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Human actions, whether considered
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad speciem</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>,
are either such as proceed from the deliberation
of reason, or from bare imagination
only. To this latter kind we refer such
actions as are done through incogitancy,
while the mind is taken up with other
thoughts; for example, to scratch the head,
to handle the beard, to move the foot,
&amp;c.; which sort of things proceed only
from a certain stirring or fleeting of the
imagination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Let it be remembered, that those
things we call morally good, which agree
to right reason; those morally evil which
disagree from right reason; and those indifferent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-387">[pg 1-387]</span><a name="Pg1-387" id="Pg1-387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which include nothing belonging
to the order of reason, and so are neither
consonant unto nor dissonant from the
same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. When we speak of the indifferency of
an individual action, it may be conceived
two ways: either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute et sine respectu
ad aliud</span></span>; or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">comparate et cum respectu
ad aliud</span></span>. In the free-will offerings, if so
be a man offered according as God had
blessed and prospered his estate, it was indifferent
to offer either a bullock, or a
sheep, or a goat; but if he chose to offer
any of them, his action of offering could
not be indifferent, but either good or evil.
When we speak of the indifferency of an
action <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">comparate</span></span>, the sense is only this,
that it is neither better nor worse than another
action, and that there is no reason to
make us choose to do it more than another
thing; but when we speak of the indifferency
of an action considered absolutely
and by itself, the simple meaning is, whether
it be either good or evil, and whether
the doing of the same must needs be
either sin or evil doing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Every thing which is indifferent in
the nature of it, is not by and by indifferent
in the use of it. But the use of a thing indifferent
ought evermore to be either chosen
or refused, followed or forsaken, according
to these three rules delivered to us in
God's word: 1. The rule of piety; 2. The
rule of charity; 3. The rule of purity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first of these rules we find, 1 Cor.
x. 31, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether, therefore, ye eat or
drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
glory of God;”</span> and Rom. xiv. 7, 8, <span class="tei tei-q">“For
none of us liveth to himself, and no man
dieth to himself. For whether we live, we
live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we
die unto the Lord:”</span> where the Apostle, as
Calvin noteth,<a id="noteref_1190" name="noteref_1190" href="#note_1190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1190</span></span></a> reasoneth from the whole to
the part. Our whole life, and, by consequence,
all the particular actions of it, ought
to be referred to God's glory, and ordered
according to his will. Again, Col. iii. 17,
<span class="tei tei-q">“And whatsoever ye do, in word or deed,
do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.”</span> In
the expounding of which words Dr Davenant
saith well, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etiam ille actiones
quæ sunt sua natura adiaphoræ, debent
tamen à Christianis fieri in nomine Christi,
hoc est, juxta voluntatem Christi, et ad
gloriam Christi</span></span>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-388">[pg 1-388]</span><a name="Pg1-388" id="Pg1-388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second rule is the rule of charity;
which teacheth us not to use anything indifferent
when scandal riseth out of it: Rom.
xiv. 21, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is good neither to eat flesh,
nor to drink wine, nor anything whereby
thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
made weak;”</span> yea, though it do not weaken,
if it be not expedient for edifying our brother,
be it never so lawful or indifferent in
its own nature, the law of charity bindeth
us to abstain from it: Rom. xiv. 19, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
us therefore follow after the things which
make for peace, and the things wherewith
one may edify another;”</span> Rom. xv. 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
every one of us please his neighbour for his
good to edification;”</span> 1 Cor. x. 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“All
things are lawful for me, but all things are
not expedient: all things are lawful for
me, but all things edify not:”</span> where the
Apostle teacheth, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in cibo</span></span>,
&amp;c.,<a id="noteref_1191" name="noteref_1191" href="#note_1191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1191</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“In
meat, drink, and the whole kind of things
indifferent, it is not enough to look whether
they be lawful, but that, farther, we are
to look whether to do or omit the same be
expedient, and may edify.”</span> The Bishop of
Winchester, preaching upon John xvi. 7,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I tell you the truth: it is expedient for
you that I go away,”</span> &amp;c., marketh, that
Christ would not go away without acquainting
his disciples with the reason of it; and
that reason was, because it was for their
good: whereupon he inferreth, 1. That we
should avoid Hophni's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non vult enim</span></span>, and
make our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vult</span></span> our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">enim</span></span>, 1 Sam. ii. 15;
that is, that we should not give our will for
a reason, but a reason for our will; 2. That
we should not, with the Corinthians, stand
upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">licet</span></span>,—it is lawful, but frame our rule
by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">expedit</span></span>,—it is expedient, 1 Cor. vi. 13;
x. 23; 3. That our rule should not be
Caiaphas' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">expedit nobis</span></span>, but Christ's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">expedit
vobis</span></span>,—for you it is good, you, the
disciples, John xi. 50; and make that the
rule of our going out and our coming in.
The heathens themselves could say that we
are born, partly for God, partly for our
country, partly for our friends, &amp;c. How
much more ought Christians to understand
that we are not born for ourselves, but for
Christ and his church. And as in the
whole course of our life, so especially in the
policy of the church, we may do nothing
(be it never so indifferent in itself) which is
not profitable for edification: 1 Cor. xiii.
26, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let all things be done to edifying.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-389">[pg 1-389]</span><a name="Pg1-389" id="Pg1-389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
From which precept Pareus inferreth, that
nothing ought to be done in the church
which doth not manifestly make for the
utility of all and every one; and that therefore
not only unknown tongues, but cold
ceremonies and idle gestures should be exploded
out of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third rule is the rule of purity,
which respecteth our peace and plerophory
of conscience, without which anything is unclean
to us, though it be clean and lawful
in its own nature: Rom xiv. 14, <span class="tei tei-q">“To him
that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to
him it is unclean,”</span> therefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">si quis aliquam
in cibo immunditiem imagineter, eo
libere uti non potest</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1192" name="noteref_1192" href="#note_1192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1192</span></span></a> Whatsoever indifferent
thing a man in his conscience judgeth
to be unlawful, he may not lawfully do
it: Rom xiv. 5, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let every man be fully
persuaded in his own mind;”</span> and verse 23,
<span class="tei tei-q">“He that doubteth is damned if he eat,
because he eateth not of faith; for whatsoever
is not of faith is sin.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nefas est
omnino</span></span>, saith Calvin,<a id="noteref_1193" name="noteref_1193" href="#note_1193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1193</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quippiam aggredi
quod putes illi (domino) displicere, imo
quod non persuasus sis illi placere</span></span>. Now
if a thing indifferent be used according to
these three rules, the use of it is not only
lawful but expedient also; but if it be not
used according to these rules, the use of it
is altogether unlawful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. And since a thing indifferent in
the nature of it can never be lawfully used,
except according to these rules, hence it
followeth, that the use of a thing indifferent
is never lawful to us when we have no other
warrant for using the same beside our own
will and arbitrement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr Forbesse speaks unadvisedly whilst he
saith,<a id="noteref_1194" name="noteref_1194" href="#note_1194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1194</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evenit nonnunquam</span></span>, &amp;c.: <span class="tei tei-q">“It falleth
out sometimes that that which was expedient
for thee to do yesterday, and to
omit this day, thou mayest, notwithstanding,
afterward either do it, or not do it, according
to thy arbitrement:”</span> As if, forsooth,
our using of things indifferent should not
evermore be determined by the rule of expediency
which God's word giveth us, but
sometimes by our own will. Dr Davenant<a id="noteref_1195" name="noteref_1195" href="#note_1195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1195</span></span></a>
could not dream that any, except the
ignorant common people, could be of this
opinion which Dr Forbesse holdeth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fallitur
vulgus</span></span>, saith he, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dum judicat licere

haec omnia ad regulam adhibenda sunt</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, as we may not use any indifferent
thing at our own pleasure; so neither
may the church, at her will and pleasure,
command the use of it: but as our practice,
so the church's injunction must be determined
and squared according to the former
rules. And if any man think that, in the
using of things indifferent, he may be led
and ruled by the church's determination,
without examining any further, let him understand
that the church's determination is
but a subordinate rule, or a rule ruled by
higher rules.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr Forbesse, perceiving how these rules
of Scripture may subvert his cause, desireth
to subject them to the church's determination,
and to make it our highest rule. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jam
autem</span></span>, saith he,<a id="noteref_1196" name="noteref_1196" href="#note_1196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1196</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in talium rerum usu,

et exhibeatur praepositis obedientia.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He hath been speaking of the rules which
God's word giveth us concerning the use of
things indifferent; and all of them he comprehendeth
under this rule, that we should
hear the church, and obey them who are set
over us, as if God's rules were subordinate
to men's rules, and not theirs to his. We
say not that every man may use things indifferent
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sua arbitratu</span></span>, but we say withal,
that neither may the church command the
use of things indifferent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">suo arbitratu</span></span>.
Both she in commanding and we in obeying
must be guided by the rules of Scripture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They who are set over us in the church have
no power given them of Christ which is not
for edifying, Eph. iv. 12. The counsel of the
apostles and elders at Jerusalem (which is a
lively pattern of a lawful synod to the world's
end) professed they would lay no other burden
upon the disciples except such things as
the law of charity made necessary for shunning
of scandal, Acts xv. 28; and so that
which they decreed had force and strength
to bind <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a charitate propter scandalum</span></span>,

nothing. Cartwright saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“It appeareth
by this place that there may be no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-391">[pg 1-391]</span><a name="Pg1-391" id="Pg1-391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

decrees and canons be not according to the
rules of the word; yet, forasmuch as every
one of us shall give account of himself and
his own deeds, we must look that whatsoever
the church decree, yet our practice, in
the use or omission of a thing indifferent,
be according to the foresaid rules.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may not, for the commandment of
men, transgress the rule of piety, by doing
anything which is not for God's glory, and
ordered according to his will; neither ought
any of us to obey men, except <span class="tei tei-q">“for the
Lord's sake,”</span> 1 Pet. ii. 13, and <span class="tei tei-q">“as the
servants of Christ, doing the will of God,”</span>
Eph. vi. 6; which teacheth us the manner
how we ought to obey men, namely, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propter

for if we should know no more but the will
of man for that which we do, then we should
be the <span class="tei tei-q">“servants of men,”</span> not the servants
of Christ. Neither yet may we for any human
ordinance break the rule of charity;
<span class="tei tei-q">“But whatsoever either would weaken, or
not edify our brother, be it never so lawful,
never so profitable to ourselves, never so

Nor, lastly, may we obey men, so as to
break the law of purity, and <span class="tei tei-q">“perform any

out of it have no warrant, in which case
tender consciences must be tendered rather
than be racked by authority, for be the

say, that in the use of matters indifferent,
the laws of those who are set over us ought
to rule us; we still answer that our practice
may not be ruled by any law of man, except

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. These considerations being permitted,
for resolution of the question in
hand, we say, 1. As touching those actions
which proceed from bare imagination,
whether they be evil and inordinate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad
speciem</span></span>, forsomuch as the imagination from
which they have their original doth not in
those actions subject itself to the conduct
and moderation of reason, but is like Gehazi,
running away without his master's
leave, let the learned give their judgment.
Howsoever, it cannot be denied, that such
actions may be and are of a civil <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad

which show forth in them reprovable
temerity, incogitancy, levity, and indecency.
But such actions belong not to
our purpose. 2. As for those actions which
proceed from the deliberation of reason,
howbeit many of them be indifferent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo
ad speciem</span></span>, yet none of them are, nor can
be indifferent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>. The
reason of this difference and distinction is,
because every action hath its species or kind,<a id="noteref_1204" name="noteref_1204" href="#note_1204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1204</span></span></a>
from the object, and a human moral action
hath its species or kind from the object referred
to the original of human actions,
which is reason. Whereupon it cometh,
that if the object of the action include
something that agreeth to the order of
reason, it shall be a good action, according
to its kind; for example, to give alms to
an indigent man. But if it include something
that is repugnant to the order of reason,
it shall be an evil action according to
its kind; as to steal or take away another
man's goods. Now sometimes it happeneth
that the object of an action doth not include
something that belongeth to the order
of reason; as to lift a straw from the ground,
to go to the field, &amp;c., such actions are indifferent,
according to their kind. But we
must pronounce far otherwise of them when
we speak of them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>, because
as they are individuated by their circumstances,
so in their individual being,
they have their goodness or badness from
the same circumstances, as hath been showed.
So that no such action as is deliberated upon
can be indifferent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>; because
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">oportet</span></span> (saith Thomas<a id="noteref_1205" name="noteref_1205" href="#note_1205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1205</span></span></a>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod quilibet

Friar Ambrosius Catarinus, following the
doctrine of Thomas, maintained in the
Council of Trent,<a id="noteref_1206" name="noteref_1206" href="#note_1206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1206</span></span></a> that to do good was a
work, the concurrences of all circumstances
is necessary, but the want of one only is sufficient
for an evil, so that howsoever among
the works considered in general, some are
indifferent, yet in the singular there is no
medium between having all the circumstances
and wanting some; therefore every
particular action is good or evil; and because
among the circumstances the end is
one, all works referred to a bad end are infected.
He further alleged St. Augustine,
that it is sin not only to refer the action to
a bad end, but also not to refer it to a good
end. Thus spake the learned friar very
appositely; and the same is the judgment
of our own divines. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De bis rebus indifferentibus</span></span>

undeniable, that Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_1209" name="noteref_1209" href="#note_1209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1209</span></span></a> himself acknowledged
no less than that every individual
human action is either good or bad
morally; and that there is a goodness which
is necessary to every action, namely, the
referring of it to the last end, and the doing
of it in faith; which goodness, if it be wanting,
the action is evil. Notwithstanding, he
will have some actions, even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quo ad individuum</span></span>,
called indifferent, for this respect,
because they are neither commanded of
God, and so necessary to be done, nor yet
forbidden, and so necessary to be omitted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of an individual action of this kind, he
saith: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manet homini respectu istius actus

quae exercitii seu contradictionis dicitur,
tum etiam ea quae specificationis seu contrarietatis

that though such an action be done in
faith, and for the right end (which general
goodness, he saith, is necessary to the action,
and commendeth a man to God), yet
the action itself is indifferent, because it is
not necessary; for a man hath liberty to
omit the same, or to do another thing;
which he illustrateth by this example:—

everything is condemned which is not of

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 9. The Doctor thinks it enough
that, in the use of a thing indifferent, I believe
it is lawful for me to do this thing, albeit
I believe and certainly know that it is
lawful to me to omit it, or do the contrary;
so that the doing of a thing in faith inferreth
not the necessity of doing it: but for
answer hereunto we say,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. We have sufficiently proven that it is
never lawful for us to do anything which is
in the nature of it indifferent, except we be
persuaded not only of the lawfulness of the
thing, but of the expediency of doing it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Of his comparing of things indifferent
together, and not considering them positively
and by themselves, we have also said
enough before.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The doing of a thing in faith inferreth
the expediency and profit of doing it, and
that is enough to take away the indifferency
of doing it; for since every indifferent
thing is either expedient to be done, or else
unlawful to be done (as hath been showed),
it followeth that either it ought to be done,
or else it ought to be left undone; therefore
it is never indifferent nor free to us to do it,
or leave it undone, at our pleasure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Because the Doctor (I perceive) sticketh
upon the term of necessity, and will
have everything which is not necessary to
be indifferent; therefore, to remove this
scruple, beside that Chrysostom and the
author of the interlineary gloss upon Matt.
xviii. 7, take the meaning of those words,
<span class="tei tei-q">“It must needs be that offences come,”</span> to be
this, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is profitable that offences come</span></em>.
Which gloss, though it be not to be received,
yet as Camero noteth,<a id="noteref_1211" name="noteref_1211" href="#note_1211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1211</span></span></a> it is ordinary
to call that necessary which is very profitable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-395">[pg 1-395]</span><a name="Pg1-395" id="Pg1-395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and expedient. Besides this, I say, we
further maintain, that in the use of things
indifferent, that which we deliberate upon
to do is never lawful to be done except it
be also necessary, though not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate
absoluta seu consequentis</span></span>, yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate
consequentiae seu ex suppositione</span></span>. Paul's
circumcising of Timothy was lawful only
because it was necessary, for he behoved by
this means to win the good will of the people
of Lystra who had once stoned him,<a id="noteref_1212" name="noteref_1212" href="#note_1212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1212</span></span></a>
otherwise he could not safely have preached
the gospel among them. Therefore he had
done wrong if he had not circumcised
Timothy, since the circumcising of him was
according to the rules of the word, and it
was expedient to circumcise him, and unexpedient
to do otherwise. And (because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
partibus idem est judicium</span></span>) whensoever
the use of any indifferent thing is according
to the rules of the word, that is, when it is
profitable for God's glory, and man's edification,
and the doer is persuaded of so much,
I say, putting this case, then (forsomuch as
not only it may, but ought to be done) the
use of it is not only lawful but necessary,
and (forsomuch as not only it needs not, but
ought not to be admitted) the omission of it
is not only unnecessary but also unlawful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, put the case, that the use of a thing
indifferent be either against or not according
to the said rules, then (forsomuch as not
only it may, but ought to be admitted) the
omission of it is not only lawful but necessary,
and (forsomuch as not only it needs not,
but may not, neither ought to be done) the
doing of it is not only unnecessary but also
unlawful. For which it maketh, that the
apostles in their decree, allege no other
ground for abstinence from blood and things
strangled (which were in their nature indifferent),
but the necessity of abstaining caused
and induced by the foresaid rules, Acts xv.

The Apostle showeth that that measure of

this dispute, which is the indifferency of
the controverted ceremonies, we shall hear
sundry reasons against it afterward. For
the present, I say no more but this: As in
every case, so most especially when we meddle
with the worship of God, or any appurtenance
thereof, the rules of the word tie
us so straitly, that that which is in its own
nature indifferent ought either to be done,
or to be left undone, according as it is either
agreeable or not agreeable to these rules; and
so is never left free to us to be done or
omitted at our pleasure: for if at all we be
(as certainly we are) abridged of our liberty,
chiefly it is in things pertaining to divine
worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I marvel why Dr Forbesse discourseth
so much for the indifferency of the
ceremonies; for, lib. 1, cap. 7, he holdeth,
that there were just reasons in the things
themselves why the pretended Assembly of
Perth should enjoin the five articles; some
of which he calleth very convenient and
profitable, and others of them necessary in
themselves. Sure, if he stand to that which
he hath there written, he cannot choose but
say that it is unlawful, both for us and for
all Christians anywhere, to omit the controverted
ceremonies; and that all such as
have at any time omitted them, have thereby
sinned, in leaving that undone which
they ought to have done—for the conveniency
and necessity of them which he pretendeth
is perpetual and universal.

Now these things which God's word
leaveth free and indifferent (in respect of
their nature and kind) are such things as
it neither showeth to be good nor evil.
Where we are further to consider, that
the word of God showeth unto us the lawfulness
or unlawfulness, goodness or badness
of things, not only by precepts and prohibitions,
but sometimes also, and more plainly,
by examples. So that, not only from the
precepts and prohibitions of the word, but
likewise from the examples recorded in the
same, we may find out that goodness or
badness of human actions which taketh away
the indifferency of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as for those who will have such
things called indifferent as are neither commanded
nor forbidden in the word of God,
I ask of them whether they speak of plain
and particular precepts and prohibitions, or
of general only? If they speak of particular
precepts and prohibitions, then, by their
rule, the baptising of young children, the
taking of water for the element of baptism;
a lecturer's public reading of Scripture in
the church upon the Sabbath day; the assembling
of synods for putting order to the
confusions of the church; the writing and
publication of the decrees of the same; and
sundry other things which the word hath
commended unto us by examples,—should
all be things indifferent, because there are
not in the word of God either particular
precepts for them, or particular prohibitions
against them. But if they speak of
general precepts and prohibitions, then are
those things commanded in the word of
God for which we have the allowed and
commended examples of such as we ought
to follow (for, in the general, we are commanded
to be followers of such examples,
Phil. iv. 8, 9; 1 Cor. xi. 1; Eph. v. 1),
though there be no particular precept for
the things themselves thus exemplified.

which shall give us here some footing, and
whereupon we mind to rear up certain superstructions,
we hold, that not only we
ought to obey the particular precepts of
the word of God, but that also <span class="tei tei-q">“we are
bound to imitate Christ, and the commendable
example of his apostles, in all things
wherein it is not evident they had special
reasons moving them thereto, which do not
concern us:”</span> which ground, as it hath
been of a long time holden and confirmed
by them of our side, so never could, nor

ever shall, our opposites subvert it. It is
long since the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abridgement</span></span> confirmed and
strengthened it, out of those places of Scripture:
Eph. v. 1, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye therefore followers

<span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye followers of me, even as I also am

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

us, if we hold this rule, what is the cause
why, at the celebration of the sacrament,
we bless not the bread severally by itself,
and the cup severally by itself, seeing Christ
did so, yet having no cause to move him
which concerns not us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Beside the common blessing of
the elements, in the beginning of the action,
we give thanks also in the several
actions of distribution, saying after this or
the like manner: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord Jesus, the
same night he was betrayed, took bread, and
when he had given thanks (as we also give
thanks to God who gave his Son to die for
us) he brake it,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“In like manner
also, after supper, he took the cup, and,
when he had given thanks (as we also give
thanks to God who gave his Son to shed
his blood for us), he gave it,”</span> &amp;c. Which
form (we conceive) may be construed to be
an imitation of the example of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Though we did not observe such a
form; yet there were two reasons to move
Christ to give thanks severally, both at the
giving of the bread, and at the giving of
the cup, neither of which concerneth us: 1.
The eucharistical supper was one continued
action with the other supper which went
before it; for it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“That whilst they
did eat, he took bread,”</span> &amp;c. Wherefore,
for more distinction of it from that supper
which immediately proceeded, it was fit that
he should give thanks severally at the giving
of each element. 2. He had to do with
the twelve apostles, whose hearts being so
greatly troubled with sorrow, John xvi. 6,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-399">[pg 1-399]</span><a name="Pg1-399" id="Pg1-399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and whose minds not well comprehending
that which they heard concerning the death
of Christ, John xvi. 12, much less those
mystical symbols of it, especially at the first
hearing, seeing, and using of the same, it
was needful for their cause distinctly and
severally to bless those elements, thereby to
help the weakness of their understanding,
and to make them the more capable of so
heavenly mysteries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. Now, having heard that which
the Bishop had to say against our rule, let
us examine his own. He holdeth,<a id="noteref_1217" name="noteref_1217" href="#note_1217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1217</span></span></a> That
in the actions of Christ's apostles, or the customs
of the church, there is nothing exemplary
and left to be imitated of us, but that
which either being moral, is generally commanded
in the decalogue, or being ceremonial
and circumstantial, is particularly commanded
by some constant precept in the
gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. This rule is most false; for it
followeth from it that the example of the
apostles' making choice of the element of
water in baptism, and requiring a confession
of faith from the person who was to be baptised;
the example also both of Christ and
his apostles using the elements of bread and
wine in the holy supper, a table at which
they did communicate, and the breaking of
the bread, are not left to be imitated of us;
because these things are ceremonial, but not
particularly commanded in the gospel. So
that according to the rule which the Bishop
holdeth, we sin in imitating Christ and his
apostles in those things, forasmuch as they
are not exemplary, nor left to be imitated
of us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. His weapons fight against his own fellows,
who allege (as we have showed elsewhere)
the custom of the church<a id="noteref_1218" name="noteref_1218" href="#note_1218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1218</span></span></a> is a sufficient
warrant for certain ceremonies questioned
betwixt them and us, which are not
particularly commanded by any precept in
the gospel. These the Bishop doth unwittingly
strike at it whilst he holdeth that
such customs of the church are not exemplary,
nor left to be imitated of us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. Wherefore we hold still our own
rule for sure and certain. Christ's actions
are either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">amanda</span></span>, as the works of redemption;
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">admiranda</span></span>, as his miracles; or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">notanda</span></span>, as many things done by him for
some particular reason proper to that time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-400">[pg 1-400]</span><a name="Pg1-400" id="Pg1-400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and case, and not belonging to us, which
things, notwithstanding, are well worthy of
our observation; or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">imitanda</span></span>, and such are
all his actions which had no such special
reason moving him thereto as do not concern
us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Calvin, upon 1 Cor. xi. 1, saith well, that
the Apostle there calls back both himself
and others to Christ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tanquam unicum
recte agendi exemplar</span></span>; and Polycarpus
Lycerus, upon Matt. xvi. 24, under that
command of following Christ, comprehendeth
the imitations of Christ's actions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most certainly it is inexcusable presumption
to leave the example of Christ, and to
do that which seemeth right in our own
eyes, as if we were wiser than he. And
now, having laid down this ground, we are
to build certain positions upon it, us follows.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. From that which hath been said
of following Christ, and the commendable
example of his apostles, in all things wherein
it is not evident that they had some such
special reason moving them to do that which
they did, as doth not concern us, our first
inference is this: That it is not indifferent
for a minister to give the sacramental elements
of bread and wine out of his own
hand to every communicant; forasmuch as
our Lord commanded his apostles to divide
the cup among them, that is, to reach it
one to another, Luke xxii. 17. Some of
the interpreters are of opinion, that the cup
spoken of by the Evangelist in that place is
not the same whereof he speaketh after,
ver. 20; but they are greatly mistaken; for
if it were as they think, then Christ did
again drink before his death of that fruit
of the vine whereof we read ver. 18, which
is manifestly repugnant to his own words.
Wherefore, as Maldonat observeth<a id="noteref_1219" name="noteref_1219" href="#note_1219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1219</span></span></a> out of
Augustine and Euthimius, there was but
one cup; whereof Luke speaketh, first, by
anticipation, and, afterward, in its own proper
place.

Lindsey<a id="noteref_1220" name="noteref_1220" href="#note_1220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1220</span></span></a> falleth here
upon a very strange speculation; and tells
us, that if all the disciples did drink, howbeit
they did not deliver the cup one to another,
but received it severally from Christ's
own hand, they divided the same among
them; because every one takes his part of
that which is parted, they divide the whole
among them. Alas! that I should blot paper
with the confutation of such fooleries.
I believe, when his Majesty hath distributed
and divided so many lands and revenues
among the prelates of Scotland, every one
of them takes his part, but dare not say,
though, that they have divided these lands
and revenues among themselves. Can twenty
or forty beggars, when an alms is distributed
among them, because every one of
them getteth his part, say, therefore, that
they themselves have parted it among them?
What, then, shall be said of the distributor
who giveth to every one his part severally,
and by himself? That man who required
that his brother should divide the inheritance
with him, did not, I trow, desire Christ to
cause his brother to take his own part of the
inheritance (there was no fear that he would
not take his part); but he desired that his
brother might give to him his part. So that,
to divide anything among men, is not to
take it, but to give it. And who did ever
confound parting and partaking, dividing a
cup and drinking a cup, which differ as
much as giving and receiving. Thus we
conclude, that when Christ commanded the
apostles to divide the cup among them, the
meaning of the words can be no other than
this, that they should give the cup one to
another; which is so plain that a
Jesuit<a id="noteref_1221" name="noteref_1221" href="#note_1221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1221</span></span></a>
also maketh it to follow upon this command,
that Christ did reach the cup <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non singulis

brake the bread into two parts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">earumque

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. Our next position which we infer,
is this: That it is not indifferent to sit,
stand, pass, or kneel, in the act of receiving
the sacramental elements of the Lord's supper,
because we are bound to follow the example
of Christ and his apostles, who used
the gesture of sitting in this holy action, as
we prove from John xiii. 12; from Matt.
xxvi. 20, with 26; Mark xiv. 18, with 22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our opposites here bestir themselves, and
move every stone against us. Three answers
they give us, which we will now consider.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, They tell us that it is not certain
that the apostles were sitting when they received
this sacrament from Christ, and that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">adhuc sub judice lis est</span></span>. Yet let us see
what they have to say against the certainty
hereof.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bishop Lindsey objecteth, that, between
their eating of the paschal supper and the
administration of the sacrament to the disciples,
five acts intervened: 1. The taking
of the bread; 2. The thanksgiving; 3. The
breaking; 4. The precept, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take ye, eat
ye;”</span> 5. The word, whereby the element
was made the sacrament. In which time,
saith he, the gesture of sitting might have
been changed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> It is first of all to be noted, that
the apostles were sitting at the instant
when Christ took the bread, for it is said
that he took bread whilst they did eat;
that is (as Maldonat<a id="noteref_1223" name="noteref_1223" href="#note_1223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1223</span></span></a> rightly expoundeth
it), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antequam surgerent, antequam mensae
et ciborum reliquiae removerentur</span></span>;
and so we use to say that men are dining
or supping so long as they sit at table
and the meat is not removed from before
them. To Christ's ministering of the
eucharistical supper together with the preceding
supper, Christians had respect when
they celebrated the Lord's supper together
with the love-feasts. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Probabile est eos ad
Christi exemplum respexisse, qui eucharistiam
inter coenandum instituit</span></span>, saith
Pareus.<a id="noteref_1224" name="noteref_1224" href="#note_1224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1224</span></span></a> But of this we need say no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-403">[pg 1-403]</span><a name="Pg1-403" id="Pg1-403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more; for the Bishop himself hath here
acknowledged no less than that they were
sitting at that time when Christ took the
bread. Only he saith, that there were five
acts which intervened before the administration
of the sacrament to the disciples (whereof
the taking of the bread was the first),
and that in this while the gesture of sitting
might have been changed; which is as much
as to say, when he took the bread they were
sitting, but they might have changed this
gesture, either in the time of taking the
bread, or in the time of thanksgiving, or in
the time of breaking the bread, or whilst he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take ye, eat ye,”</span> or lastly, in the
time of pronouncing those words, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is
my body”</span> (for this is the word whereby, in
the Bishop's judgment, the element was
made the sacrament, as we shall see afterward).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now but, by his leave, we will reduce
his five acts to three; for thus speaketh the
text, <span class="tei tei-q">“And as they did eat, Jesus took
bread, and blessed it and break it, and gave
it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is
my body,”</span> Matt. xxvi. 26; Mark xiv. 22.
Whence it is manifest, that the giving of
the bread to the disciples, which no man, I
suppose, will deny to have been the administration
of it, went before the two last
acts which the Bishop reckoneth out. Nothing,
therefore, is left to him but to say,
that their gesture of sitting might have been
changed, either in the taking or in the
blessing, or in the breaking, or else between
the taking and the blessing, or between the
blessing and the breaking; yet doth the
text knit all the three together by such a
contiguity and connection as showeth unto
us that they did all make up but one continued
action, which could not admit any interruption.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. I saw a prelate sit down to his
breakfast, and, as he did eat, he took some
cups, and, having called for more, he said, he
thanked God that he was never given to his
belly; and with that he made a promise to
one in the company, which he brake within
two days after. Would any man question
whether or not the prelate was sitting when
he made this promise, forasmuch as between
his sitting down to meat and the making of
the promise there intervened his taking of
some cups, his calling for more, and his pronouncing
of these words, I thank God that
I was never given to my belly? Yet might
one far more easily imagine a change of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-404">[pg 1-404]</span><a name="Pg1-404" id="Pg1-404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prelate's gesture than any such change of
the apostles' gesture in that holy action
whereof we speak. Because the text setteth
down such a continued, entire, unbroken,
and uninterrupted action, therefore Calvin
gathereth out of the text that the apostles
did both take and eat the sacramental bread
whilst they were sitting. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non legimus</span></span>,

giving of the bread to the apostles. And
that the apostles were still sitting when they

prostrating themselves in the last supper,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. But now having heard Bishop
Lindsey, let us hear what Paybody<a id="noteref_1233" name="noteref_1233" href="#note_1233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1233</span></span></a> will
say. He taketh him to another subterfuge,
and tells us, that though we read that
Christ took bread whilst they did eat, yet
can it not be concluded hence that he took
bread whilst they did sit; because, saith he,
<span class="tei tei-q">“as they did eat,”</span> is expounded by Luke
(chap. xxii. 20) and Paul (1 Cor. xi. 25) to
be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after they had done eating</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after
supper</span></em>. Thus is their languages divided.
Bishop Lindsey did yield to us, that when
Christ took bread they were sitting; and
his conjecture was, that this gesture of sitting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-405">[pg 1-405]</span><a name="Pg1-405" id="Pg1-405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
might have been changed after the taking
of the bread. Paybody saw that he
had done with the argument if he should
grant that they were sitting when Christ
took bread, therefore he calleth that in
question. Vulcan's own gimmers could not
make his answer and the Bishop's to stick
together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But let us examine the ground which
Paybody takes for his opinion. He would
prove from Luke and Paul, that when Matthew
and Mark say, <span class="tei tei-q">“As they were eating,
Jesus took bread,”</span> the meaning is only
this, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">After supper, Jesus took bread</span></em>; importing,
that Christ's taking of bread did
not make up one continued action with their
eating, and that therefore their gesture of
sitting might have been changed between
their eating of the preceding supper and
his taking of the sacramental bread.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whereunto we answer, that there are
two opinions touching the suppers which
Christ did eat with his disciples that night
wherein he was betrayed. And whichsoever
the reader please to follow, it shall be most
easy to break all the strength of the argument
which Paybody opposeth unto us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. First, then, some do think that
Christ, having kept the passover according
to the law (which is not particularly
related, but supposed, by the evangelists),
sat down to a common or ordinary supper,
at which he told the disciples that one of
them should betray him. And of this judgment
are Calvin and Beza, upon Matt. xxvi.
21; Pareus, upon Matt. xxvi. 21; Fulk and
Cartwright, against the Rhemists, upon 1
Cor. xi. 23; Tolet and Maldonat, upon
John xiii. 2; Cornelius Jansenius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conc.

Forsterus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conc. 4, de Pass.</span></span>, p. 538; Christophorus
Pelargus, in John xiii., quest. 2,

judgment is confirmed are these:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Many societies convened to the eating
of the paschal supper by twenties.<a id="noteref_1234" name="noteref_1234" href="#note_1234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1234</span></span></a> And if
twenty was often the number of them who
convened to the eating of the same (which
also confirmeth their opinion who think
that other men and women in the inn did
eat both the paschal and evangelical supper
together with the apostles in Christ's company),
it is not very likely (say some) that
all those were sufficiently satisfied and fed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-406">[pg 1-406]</span><a name="Pg1-406" id="Pg1-406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The paschal supper was not for banquetting

also writeth.<a id="noteref_1237" name="noteref_1237" href="#note_1237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1237</span></span></a>

which Christ and his apostles did eat

doubts not to call it a carnal supper,<a id="noteref_1240" name="noteref_1240" href="#note_1240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1240</span></span></a>
an earthly repast, a feast for the belly,
which lets us know, that the sacramental
bread and wine was ordained, not for feeding
their bodies, which were already satisfied
by the ordinary and daily supper, but for
the nourishment of the soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. That beside the paschal and evangelical
suppers, Christ and his apostles had also
that night another ordinary supper, Fulk
proveth by the broth wherein the sop was
dipped,<a id="noteref_1241" name="noteref_1241" href="#note_1241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1241</span></span></a>
John xiii. 26. Whereas there was
no such broth ordained by the divine institution
to be used in the paschal supper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. That there were two suppers before
the eucharistical they gather from John
xiii. For, first, the paschal supper was
ended, ver. 2, after which Christ washed
his disciples' feet. And thereafter we read,
ver. 12, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">resumptis vestibus rursum ad caenam
ordinariam consedisse.</span></span><a id="noteref_1242" name="noteref_1242" href="#note_1242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1242</span></span></a> The dividing
of the passover into two services or two suppers
had no warrant at all from the first institution
of that sacrament, for which cause
they think it not likely that Christ would
have thus divided it according to the device
and custom of the Jews in latter times, for
so much as in marriage (and much more in
the passover) he did not allow of that which
from the beginning was not so. Neither
seemeth it to them any way probable, that
Christ would have interrupted the eating of
the passover with the washing of his disciples'
feet before the whole paschal supper
was ended, and they had done eating of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect</span></span>. 5. But others (and those very judicious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-407">[pg 1-407]</span><a name="Pg1-407" id="Pg1-407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
too) are of opinion, that that second
course whereunto Christ sat down after the
washing of his disciples' feet, and at which
he told them that one of them should betray
him, was not an ordinary or common
supper (because the paschal supper was
enough of itself to satisfy them), but a part
of the paschal supper. And from the Jewish
writers they prove that so the custom
was to divide the passover into two courses
or services. As for that wherein Christ
dipped the sop, they take it to have been
the sauce which was used in the paschal
supper, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">charoseth</span></span>, of which the Hebrews
write, that it was made of the palm
tree branches, or of dry figs, or of raisins,
which they stamped and mixed with vinegar
till it was thick as mustard, and made like
clay, in memory of the clay wherein they
wrought in Egypt, and that they used to
dip both the unleavened bread and the bitter
herbs into this sauce. And as touching
that place, John xiii., they expound it by
the custom of the Jews, which was to have
two services or two suppers in the passover;
and take those words, ver. 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“Supper being
ended,”</span> to be meant of the first service,
and sitting down again to supper, ver. 12, to
be meant of the second service.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. If those two opinions could be
reconciled and drawn together into one, by
holding that that second course whereunto
Christ sat down after the washing of his disciples'
feet, was (for the substance of it) a
common supper, but yet it hath been and
may be rightly called the second service of
the paschal supper, for that it was eaten the
same night wherein the paschal lamb was
eaten, so should all the difference be taken
away; but if the maintainers of these opinions
will not be thus agreed, let the reader
consider to which of them he will adhere.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the first opinion be followed, then it
will be most easily answered to Paybody,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inter coenandum instituta fuit eucharistia,
cum jam rursum mensoe accubuissent.
Sed post coenam paschalem, et usum
agni legalis.</span></span><a id="noteref_1243" name="noteref_1243" href="#note_1243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1243</span></span></a> When Matthew and Mark
say, As they did eat, Jesus took bread,
they speak of the common or ordinary supper;
but when Luke and Paul say, that he
took the cup after supper, they speak of the
paschal supper, which was eaten before the
common supper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, if the reader follow the other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-408">[pg 1-408]</span><a name="Pg1-408" id="Pg1-408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opinion, which holdeth that Christ had no
other supper that night before the evangelical
except the paschal only, yet still the
answer to Paybody shall be easy; for whereas
he would prove from those words of Luke
and Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">“Likewise also the cup after supper,”</span>
that when Matthew and Mark say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“As they did eat, Jesus took bread,”</span> their
meaning is only this, <span class="tei tei-q">“After supper Jesus
took bread,”</span> he reasoneth very inconsiderately,
forasmuch as Luke and Paul say not
of the bread, but of the cup only, that Jesus
took it after supper. And will Paybody
say, that he took the cup so soon as he took
the bread? If we will speak with Scripture,
we must say, that as they did eat the
preceding supper (to which we read they
sat down) Jesus took bread; for nothing at
all intervened betwixt their eating of that
other preceding supper, and his taking of
the eucharistical cup, there intervened the
taking, blessing, breaking, distributing, and
eating of the bread.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, therefore, from that which hath been
said, we may well conclude that our opposites
have no reason which they do or can
object against the certainty of that received
tenet, that the apostles received from Christ
the sacramental bread and wine whilst they
were sitting. Dr Forbesse himself<a id="noteref_1244" name="noteref_1244" href="#note_1244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1244</span></span></a> setteth
down some testimonies of Musculus, Chamier,
and the professors of Leyden, all acknowledging
that the apostles, when they
received the Lord's supper, were still sitting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. The second answer that our opposites
hath given us, followeth: They say,
that though the apostles did not change
their gesture of sitting which they used in
the former supper, when all this is granted
to us, yet there is as great difference betwixt
our form of sitting and that form of the
Jews which the apostles used as there is
betwixt <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sedere</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jacere</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Put the case it were so, yet it
hath been often answered them, that the
apostles kept the table-gesture used in that
nation, and so are we bound herein to follow
their example, by keeping the table-gesture
used in this nation. For this keeping of
the usual table gesture of the nation wherein
we live is not a forsaking but a following of
the commendable example of the apostles,
even as whereas they drank the wine which
was drunk in that place, and we drink the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-409">[pg 1-409]</span><a name="Pg1-409" id="Pg1-409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wine which is drunk in this place, yet do we
not hereby differ from that which they did.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The words used by the evangelists
signify our form of sitting no less than the
Jewish, Calepine, Scapula, and Thomasius,
in their dictionaries, take ἀναπίπτω, ἀνακλίνω,
ἀνακλίνομαι, ἀνάκειμαι, ποράκειμαι,
κατάκειμαι, and the Latin words <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">discumbo,
recumbo, accumbo</span></span> (used by Arias, Montanus,
Beza, Marlorat, Tremellius, &amp;c., in
their versions), not only for lying, but also
for such sitting as is opposed to lying, even
for sitting upright at table after our custom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. There is not so great a difference betwixt
our form of sitting and that which the
Jews used as our opposites allege. For as
Didoclavius showeth out of Casaubon;<a id="noteref_1245" name="noteref_1245" href="#note_1245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1245</span></span></a> their
sitting at banquets was only with a leaning
upon the left arm, and so not lying, but sitting
with a certain inclination. When,
therefore, we read of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lecti discubitorii tricliniares,
in quibus inter coenandum discumbebant</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1246" name="noteref_1246" href="#note_1246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1246</span></span></a>
we must understand them to
have been seats which compassed three
sides of the table (the fourth side being left
open and void for them who served), and
wherein they did sit with some sort of inclination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet Bishop Lindsey is bold to aver,<a id="noteref_1247" name="noteref_1247" href="#note_1247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1247</span></span></a>
that the usual table gesture of the Jews was
lying along, and this he would prove from
Amos vi. 4, <span class="tei tei-q">“They lie upon beds of ivory,
they stretch themselves out upon their
couches.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. If we should yield to this prelate
his own meaning wherein he taketh
these words, yet how thinks he that the
gesture of drunkards and gluttons, which
they used when they were pampering themselves
in all excess of riot, and for which also
they are upbraided by the Spirit of God, was
either the ordinary table-gesture of the
Jews, or the gesture used by Christ and
his apostles in their last supper?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. If any gesture at all be touched in
those words which the prelate citeth, it was
the gesture they used when they lay down
to sleep, and not their table-gesture when
they did eat; for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mitta</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ngheres</span></span> (the
two words which Amos useth) signify a bed
or a couch wherein a man useth to lay himself
down to sleep. And in this sense we
find both these words, Psal. vi. 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“All the
night make I my bed (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mittathi</span></span>) to swim: I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-410">[pg 1-410]</span><a name="Pg1-410" id="Pg1-410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
water my couch (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ngharsi</span></span>) with my tears.”</span>
The Shunnamite prepared for Elisha a
chamber, and therein set for him a bed
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mitta</span></span>), and a table, and a stool, and a
candlestick, 2 Kings iv. 10. The stool or
chair was for sitting at table, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mitta</span></span>, the
bed, was for lying down to sleep. Now, the
prelate, I hope, will not say, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lecti
tricliniares</span></span>, wherein the Jews used to sit
at table, and which compassed three sides of
the same (as hath been said), were their beds
wherein they did lie and sleep all night.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, 3. The place must be yet more
exactly opened up. That word which is
turned in our English books, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they lie</span></span>,
cometh from the radix <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">schachav</span></span>, which
in Pagnin's lexicon is turned <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dormire</span></span>. We
find, Ruth iii. 7, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lischcav</span></span>, which Arias
Montanus turned <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad dormiendum</span></span>, to sleep.
Our own English translation, 2 Sam. xi. 9,
saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Uriah slept</span></span>,”</span> where the original hath
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vauschcav</span></span>; and the very same word is put
most frequently in the books of the Kings
and the Chronicles, where they speak of the
death of the kings of Judah and Israel.
Pagnin turneth it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et dormivit</span></span>; and our
English translators everywhere, <span class="tei tei-q">“And he
slept with his fathers,”</span> &amp;c. These things
being considered, we must, with Calvin, read
the place of Amos thus: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Qui decumbunt
vel dormiunt in lectis.</span></span> The other word
which the prophet useth is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seruchim</span></span>. Our
English version turneth it, <span class="tei tei-q">“They stretch
themselves out;”</span> but Pagnin, Buxtorff,
Tremellius, and Tarnovius, come nearer the
sense, who read <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">redundantes, superfluentes</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">luxuriantes</span></span>; which sense the English
translation also hath in the margin. The
Septuagints followed the same sense, for they
read, κατασπαταλὼντες, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">living in pleasure</span></span>.
So, 1 Tim. v. 6, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">she that lived in
pleasure</span></span>, σπαταλῶσοι; and, James v. 5, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ye
have lived in pleasure</span></span>, ἐσπαταλησατε. The
radix is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sarach</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">redundavit</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">luxuriavit</span></span>.
So, Exod. xxvi. 12, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sarach</span></span>, and, verse 13,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">saruach</span></span>, is put for a surplusage or superfluous
remainder, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">redundans superfluum</span></span>,
as Tremellius readeth. Now, then, it is
evident that the thing which Amos layeth
to the charge of those who were at ease in
Zion, in the words which the prelate citeth
against us, is, that they slept upon beds of
ivory (such was their softness and superfluity),
and swimmed in excessive pleasures
upon their couches; and, incontinent, their
filthy and muddy stream of carnal delicacy
and excessive voluptuousness which defiled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-411">[pg 1-411]</span><a name="Pg1-411" id="Pg1-411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their beds, led him back to the unclean
fountain out of which it issued, even their
riotous pampering of themselves at table;
therefore he subjoineth, <span class="tei tei-q">“And eat the
lambs out of the flock,”</span> &amp;c. For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex mensis
itur ad cubilia, ex gula in venerem</span></span>, saith
Cornelius à Lapide, commenting upon the
same text. Thus have I cleared the place
in such sort, that the Bishop cannot but
shoot short of his aims; wherefore I go on
to other replies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. If the apostles, when they received
the Lord's supper, or the Jews, when they
did eat at table, were lying all along, how
could their mouths receive drink unspilt?
or how could they have the use of both their
arms? which the Bishop himself would not,
I am sure, gainsay, if he would once try the
matter in his own person, and essay to eat
and drink whilst lying along.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The words used by Matthew, chap.
xxvi. 10, and by Mark, chap. xiv. 18,
where they speak of Christ sitting down
with the twelve, is also used by John,
chap. vi. 11, where he speaketh of the
peoples' sitting down upon the grass to
eat the loaves and fishes: and will any
man think that the people did eat lying
along upon the grass, where they might far
better sit upright?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. If our opposites like to speak with
others, then let them look back upon the
testimonies which I have alleged before.

Martyr, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sedentibus aut discumbentibus</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. If they like to speak to themselves:
Camero,<a id="noteref_1250" name="noteref_1250" href="#note_1250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1250</span></span></a> speaking of John's leaning on

it cannot be denied that the gesture of
Christ and his apostles at the last supper
was sitting,—only, saith he, the evangelists
leave it uncertain whether this sitting was
upright, or somewhat leaning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 8. Their third answer is, that Christ's
sitting at the last supper is no more exemplary
and imitable than the upper chamber,
or the night season, or the sex and number
of communicants, &amp;c.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-412">[pg 1-412]</span><a name="Pg1-412" id="Pg1-412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. As for the sex and number of
communicants, Dr Fulk<a id="noteref_1252" name="noteref_1252" href="#note_1252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1252</span></span></a> rightly observeth,
that it is not certain from Scripture that
twelve men only, and no women, did communicate
(as Bishop Lindsey<a id="noteref_1253" name="noteref_1253" href="#note_1253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1253</span></span></a> would have us
certainly to believe); but suppose it were
certain,<a id="noteref_1254" name="noteref_1254" href="#note_1254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1254</span></span></a> yet for this, and all the other circumstances,
which are not exemplary, there
were special reasons either in the urgency of
the legal necessity, or in the exigency of
present and accidental occasions, which do
not concern us: whereas the gesture of
sitting was freely and purposely chosen, and
so intended to be exemplary, especially since
there was no such reason moving Christ to
use this gesture of sitting as doth not concern
us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bishop saith,<a id="noteref_1255" name="noteref_1255" href="#note_1255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1255</span></span></a> that his sitting at the
former supper might have been the reason
which moved him to sit at the eucharistical
supper; but if Christ had not purposely
made choice of the gesture of sitting as the
fittest and most convenient for the eucharistical
supper, his sitting at the former supper
could be no reason to move him, as may
appear by this example: There are some
gentlemen standing in a nobleman's waiting-room;
and after they have stood there a
while, the nobleman cometh forth; they
begin to speak to him, and, as they speak,
still they stand. Now, can any man say
that the reason which moveth them to stand
when they speak to the nobleman, is, because
they were standing before he came to
them? So doth the Bishop come short of
giving any special reason for Christ's sitting
which concerneth not us. He can allege no
more but Christ's sitting at the former supper,
which could be no reason, else he should
have also risen from the eucharistical supper
to wash the disciples' feet, even as he
rose from the former supper for that effect.
Wherefore, we conclude, that Christ did
voluntarily, and of set purpose, choose sitting
as the fittest and best beseeming gesture for
that holy banquet.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, Hooker's<a id="noteref_1256" name="noteref_1256" href="#note_1256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1256</span></span></a> verdict of the gesture
of Christ and his apostles in this holy supper
is, <span class="tei tei-q">“That our Lord himself did that
which custom and long usage had made fit;
we, that which fitness and great decency
hath made usual.”</span> In which words, because
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-413">[pg 1-413]</span><a name="Pg1-413" id="Pg1-413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cause he importeth that they have better
warrants for their kneeling than Christ had
for his sitting (which is blasphemy), I leave
them as not worthy of an answer. Howsoever,
let it be noted that he acknowledged,
by kneeling they depart from the example
of Christ.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. The third consequence which we
infer upon our former rule of following the
example of Christ is, that it is not a thing
indifferent to omit the repetition of those
words, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is my body,”</span> enunciatively
and demonstratively in the act of distributing
the eucharistical bread; and far less
is it indifferent so to omit this demonstrative
speech in the distribution, as in place of it
to surrogate a prayer to preserve the soul
and body of the communicant unto everlasting
life. Our reason is, because Christ
(whose example herein we ought to follow)
used no prayer in the distribution, but that
demonstrative enunciation, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is my
body.”</span> But we go forward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. The fourth position we draw from
the same rule is, that it is not indifferent
for a minister to omit the breaking of the
bread at the Lord's table after the consecration
and in the distribution of it, because he
ought to follow the example of Christ, who,
after he had blessed the bread, and when
he was distributing it to them who were at
table, brake it,<a id="noteref_1257" name="noteref_1257" href="#note_1257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1257</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">manibus comminuendo

rightly condemn those who, though they
break the bread <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in multas minutias</span></span>, yet
they break it not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu sacramentali</span></span>.
Such a breaking as this (he saith well) is
not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mystica</span></span>, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">coquinaria</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. The fifth position, drawn from the
very same ground is, that it is not indifferent
for a minister, in the act of distribution, to
speak in the singular number, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Take thou,
eat thou, drink thou</span></span>; because he should
follow the example of Christ, who, in the
distribution, spake in the plural number,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-414">[pg 1-414]</span><a name="Pg1-414" id="Pg1-414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Take ye, eat ye, drink ye</span></span>; and he who
followeth not Christ's example herein, by his
speaking in the singular to one, he maketh
that to be a private action betwixt himself
and the communicant, which Christ made
public and common by his speaking to all at
one time.

at all these speeches in the plural,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Take ye, eat ye, drink ye</span></span>,—but for not
breaking the bread in the very act of distribution,—for
not pronouncing demonstratively
those words, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is my body,”</span> in
the very act of distribution,—for not speaking
in the plural number, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take ye,”</span> &amp;c.—in
the very act of distribution, as Christ did,
having no other reasons to move him than
such as concern us. Why, then, did not
the Bishop say something to the point which
we press him with? or shall we excuse him
because he had nothing to say to it?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 5. Now, last of all, we find yet another
point, whereby the Bishop<a id="noteref_1260" name="noteref_1260" href="#note_1260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1260</span></span></a> departeth
from the example and mind of Christ. He
saith that, by the sacramental word, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is
my body,”</span> the bread is made the sacrament,
&amp;c.; and that without this word, &amp;c., all our
prayers and wishes should serve to no use.
Where he will have the bread to be otherwise
consecrated by us than it was consecrated
by Christ; for that Christ did not
consecrate the bread to be the sacrament of
his body by those words, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is my
body,”</span> it is manifest, because the bread was
consecrated before his pronouncing of those
words; or else what meaneth the blessing
of it before he brake it? It was both blessed
and broken, and he was also distributing
it to the disciples, before ever he said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is my body.”</span> Beza saith, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Benedictionem

<span class="tei tei-q">“This is my body,”</span> have no use at all
in making the bread to be a sacrament;
but that which giveth us dislike is,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. That the Bishop maketh not the word
and prayer together, but the word alone, to
sanctify the bread and wine. Now, if both
the word and prayer be necessary to sanctify
the creatures for the food of our bodies,
1 Tim. iv. 5, much more are they necessary
to sanctify them for the food of our souls.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dum eucharistiam fieri dixerunt mystica
precc, invocatione nominis divini, solemni
benedictione, gratiarum actione.</span></span> 2. That
he makes not the whole word of the institution
to sanctify the bread, but only that
one sentence, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is my body;”</span> whereas
Christ's will is declared, and, consequently,
the elements sanctified by the whole words
of the institution,<a id="noteref_1268" name="noteref_1268" href="#note_1268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1268</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus took the bread,
and when he had given thanks, he brake it,
and said, Take, eat, this is my body which
is broken for you, this do in remembrance
of me,”</span> &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That he acknowledged not the bread,
though sanctified by prayer, to be the sacrament,
except that very word be pronounced,
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is my body.”</span> Now, when
a minister hath, from Christ's will and institution,
declared that he hath appointed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-416">[pg 1-416]</span><a name="Pg1-416" id="Pg1-416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bread and wine to be the elements of his
body and blood, when he hath also declared
the essential rites of this sacrament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, lastly, when, by the prayer of consecration,
he hath sanctified the bread and
wine which are present, put the case, that
all this while those prescript sentences,
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is my body,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“This cup is the New
Testament in my blood,”</span> have not been
pronounced, yet what hindereth the bread
and wine from being the sacramental elements
of the Lord's body and blood? It is
sounder divinity to say, that the consecration
of a sacrament doth not depend <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex
certa aliqua formula verborum</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1269" name="noteref_1269" href="#note_1269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1269</span></span></a> For it is
evident that, in baptism, there is not a certain
form of words prescribed, as Bellarmine

not, <span class="tei tei-q">“Say, I baptise thee in the name,”</span>
&amp;c.: so that he prescribeth not what should
be done. Aquinas likewise holdeth,<a id="noteref_1271" name="noteref_1271" href="#note_1271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1271</span></span></a> that
the consecration of a sacrament is not absolutely
tied to a certain form of words. And
so saith Conradus Vorstius,<a id="noteref_1272" name="noteref_1272" href="#note_1272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1272</span></span></a> speaking of the
eucharist. Wherefore Vossius<a id="noteref_1273" name="noteref_1273" href="#note_1273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1273</span></span></a> doth rightly
condemn the Papists, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod consecrationem

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. Having spoken of the nature of
things indifferent, and showed which things
be such; also of the rule whereby to try the
indifferency of things: which rule we have
applied to certain particular cases;—it remaineth
to say somewhat of the main and
general purpose, which is principally questioned
in this last part of our dispute, viz.,
whether cross, kneeling, holidays, bishopping,
and the other controverted ceremonies
wherewith our church is pressed this
day, be such things as we may use freely
and indifferently? The negative (which we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-417">[pg 1-417]</span><a name="Pg1-417" id="Pg1-417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hold) is strongly confirmed by those arguments
which, in the third part of this our
dispute, we have put in order against the
lawfulness of those ceremonies. Notwithstanding
we have thought fit to add somewhat
more in this place. And, first, we say,
whatsoever be the condition of the ceremonies
in their own nature, they cannot be indifferently
embraced and used by the church
of Scotland, which hath not only once cast
them forth, but also given her great oath
solemnly to the God of heaven, both witnessing
her detestation of the Roman Antichrist's
<span class="tei tei-q">“five bastard sacraments, with all
his rites, ceremonies, and false doctrine,
added to the ministration of the true sacraments,
without the word of God; all his
vain allegories, rites, signs, and traditions,
brought in the kirk, without or against the
word of God;”</span> and likewise <span class="tei tei-q">“promising,
and swearing to continue,”</span> as well <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
discipline and use of the holy sacraments,”</span>
as <span class="tei tei-q">“in the doctrine,”</span> of this reformed
church of Scotland, which then first she
embraced and used after she was truly reformed
from Popery and popish abuses.
And this which I say may be seen in the
general Confession of Faith, sworn and subscribed
by his Majesty's father, of everlasting
memory, anno 1580, and by the several
parochines in the land, at his Majesty's
strait command; which also was renewed
and sworn again, anno 1596, by the General
Assembly, by provincial assemblies, by
presbyteries and particular parish churches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. No reformed church in Europe
is so strictly tied by the bond of an oath
and subscription, to hold fast her first discipline
and use of the sacraments, and to hold
out popish rites, as is the church of Scotland.
And who knoweth not that an oath
doth always oblige and bind, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quando est

What one of all those conditions was here
wanting? Can we then say any less than a
pope said before us:<a id="noteref_1275" name="noteref_1275" href="#note_1275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1275</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non est tutum quemlibet

which maketh so small account of the violation
of the aforesaid oath, which hath as
great power to bind us as that oath of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-418">[pg 1-418]</span><a name="Pg1-418" id="Pg1-418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
princes of Israel made to the Gibeonites,
had to bind their posterity, 2 Sam. xxi.
1, 2; for it was made by the whole incorporation
of this land, and hath no term at
which it may cease to bind. Nay (in some
respects) it bindeth more straitly than that
oath of the princes of Israel. For, 1. That
was made by the princes only; this by
prince, pastors, and people: 2. That was
made rashly (for the text showeth that
they asked not counsel from the mouth of
the Lord); this with most religious and due
deliberation: 3. That was made to men;
this to the great God: 4. That sworn but
once; this once and again.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 3. Some of our opposites go about
to derogate somewhat from the binding
power of that oath of the princes of Israel.
They are so nettled therewith that they
fitch hither and thither. Dr Forbesse<a id="noteref_1276" name="noteref_1276" href="#note_1276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1276</span></span></a>
speaketh to the purpose thus: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juramentum
Gibeonitis praestitum contra ipsius
Dei mandatum, et inconsulta Deo, non
potuissent Josuae et Israelitae opere perficere
nisi Deus, extraordinarie de suo mandato
dispensasset, compassione poenitentis
illius populi Gibeonitei, et propter honorem
sui nominis, ut neque foedifragorum
fautor, neque supplicium paenitentium aspernator
esse videretur.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. If the oath was against the commandment
of God, what dishonour had come
to the name of God though he had not patronised
the swearers of it, but hindered
them from fulfilling their oath? If a Christian
swear to kill a pagan, and hereafter repent
of his oath, and not perform it, can
there any dishonour redound thereby to the
name of Christ? The Doctor, forsooth,
must say so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Where hath he read of the repentance
of the Gibeonites, which God would
not despise?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. If an oath made against the commandment
of God (the breach of the commandment
being dispensed with) bindeth
so strictly and inviolably as that oath
of the princes of Israel did, how much
more ought we to think ourselves strictly
and inviolably bound, by the solemn oath
of the church of Scotland, which was not
repugnant but most consonant to the word
of God, even our adversaries themselves
being judges? for thus speaketh one of
them: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod antem jurarunt nostrates,
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-419">[pg 1-419]</span><a name="Pg1-419" id="Pg1-419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">

Doctor hath gained nothing, but loosed much,
by that which he saith of the Israelites'
oath: he hath even fanged himself faster
in the snare which he thought to escape.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
O but, saith the Doctor, that which they
did, either in swearing or in performing
their oath, against the express commandment
of God, we may not draw into an
ordinary example.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> It was against the commandment of
God; no man will say that we should follow
either their swearing or their performing
of their oath. Yet, in the meantime, the
Doctor is pressed with this argument, that if
their unlawful oath (in the case of God's
dispensation) did bind their posterity, much
more doth that oath of the church of Scotland
(which the Doctor hath acknowledged
lawful and commendable) bind us this day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 4. But, 4. Albeit the Doctor hath
hereby given us scope and advantage enough
against himself; nevertheless, for the truth's
sake, I add, that it cannot be showed how
that oath of the princes of Israel was against
the express commandment of God; but it
rather appeareth that it was agreeable to
the same. For, as Tremellius<a id="noteref_1278" name="noteref_1278" href="#note_1278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1278</span></span></a> hath it noted,
that commandment, Deut. xx., whereby
the Israelites were commanded to save alive
nothing in the cities of the Canaanites, was
to be only understood of such cities among
them as should make war with them, and
be besieged by them. But the Gibeonites
were not of this sort; for they sought their
lives before the Israelites came to them.
And by the same means Rahab and her
father's house got their life, because they
sought it, Josh. ii. Calvin also serveth:<a id="noteref_1279" name="noteref_1279" href="#note_1279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1279</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jussos fuisse Israelitas pacem omnibus offere.</span></span>
And Junius, upon Deut. xx., distinguisheth
well two laws of war given to Israel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first law is concerning offering peace
to all; which law is general and common as
well to the Canaanites as to foreign nations:
<span class="tei tei-q">“When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight
against it, then proclaim peace unto it. And
it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace,
then it shall be that all the people that is
found therein shall be tributaries unto thee,
and they shall serve thee.”</span> Which commandment
was afterward observed by Israel;
of whom we read, <span class="tei tei-q">“That when Israel
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-420">[pg 1-420]</span><a name="Pg1-420" id="Pg1-420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was strong, they put the Canaanites to tribute,
and did not utterly drive them out,”</span>
Josh. xvii. 13; Judges i. 28: by Solomon
also, who did not cut off the people that
were left of the Hittites and the Amorites,
but only made them to pay tribute, 2 Chron.
viii. 7, 8. That which I say is further confirmed
by another place, Josh. xi. 19, 20,
where it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“There was not a city that
made peace with the children of Israel save
the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; all
other they took in battle. For it was of the
Lord to harden their hearts, that they should
come against Israel in battle, that he might
destroy them utterly, and that they might
have no favour; but that he might destroy
them, as the Lord commanded Moses.”</span>
From which words it appeareth, that if the
Canaanites had made peace with the children
of Israel, they were to show them favour; and
that they were bound by the commandment
of the Lord to destroy them, then only, and
in that case, if they would not accept peace,
but make war; whence it cometh, that the
cause of the destruction of the Canaanites is
imputed to their own hardness and contumacy
in not accepting of peace, and not to
any commandment which God had given to
Israel for destroying them. In a word, it
was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas signi</span></span>, which, in one place,
Deut. xx. 10, showed the Israelites what
was their duty, namely, to offer peace to
all, even to the Canaanites, and not to cut
them off if they should accept the peace;
but it was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas beneplaciti</span></span>, which, as
we read in another place, Deut. vii. 2, decreed
to deliver the Canaanites before the
Israelites, that is, to harden their hearts to
come against them in battle, and so to overrule
the matter, by a secret and inscrutable
providence, that the Israelites might lawfully
and should certainly destroy them and
show them no mercy. Even as that same
God who, by one word, showed unto Abraham
what was his duty, bidding him offer
up his son Isaac, Gen. xxii. 2, by another
word signified unto him what he had decreed
to be done, forbidding him to lay his
hand upon the lad, or to do anything unto
him, ver. 12. But this, I know, will be very
unsavoury language to many Arminianised
conformitants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other law of war which Junius, upon
Deut. xx., observeth, prescribed to the Israelites
how they should deal with them who
refused their peace. And here only was
the difference made betwixt the cities which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-421">[pg 1-421]</span><a name="Pg1-421" id="Pg1-421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were very far off and the cities of the Canaanites,
Deut. xx. 15, 16; but the first
law was common, as hath been proven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Joseph Hall seemeth to deny that the
oath of the princes of Israel had any power
to bind, but upon another ground than Dr
Forbesse took to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“It would seem
very questionable (saith Hall<a id="noteref_1280" name="noteref_1280" href="#note_1280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1280</span></span></a>) whether Joshua
needed to hold himself bound to this
oath; for fraudulent conventions oblige not;
and Israel had put in a direct caveat of their
vicinity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> I marvel how it could enter in his
mind to think this matter questionable, since
the violation of that oath was afterwards
punished with three years' famine, 2 Sam.
xxi. 1, 2. Yet let us hearken to his reasons.
One of them is forged; for the
princes of Israel who sware unto them put
in no caveat at all. The text saith only in
the general, that they sware unto them,
Josh. ix. 15. As touching his other reason,
it is answered by Calvin,<a id="noteref_1281" name="noteref_1281" href="#note_1281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1281</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juris jurandi
religio</span></span>, saith he, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eousque sancta
apud nos esse debet, ne erroris praetextu
à pactis discedemus, etiam in quibus fuimus
decepti</span></span>. Which, that it may be made
more plain unto us, let us, with the Casuists,
distinguish a twofold error in swearing.<a id="noteref_1282" name="noteref_1282" href="#note_1282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1282</span></span></a>
For if the error be about the very substance
of the thing (as when a man contracts marriage
with one particular person, taking her
to be another person) the oath bindeth not;
but if the error be only about some extrinsical
or accidental circumstance (such as was
the error of the Israelites' taking the Gibeonites
to dwell afar off when they dwelt at
hand), the oath ceaseth not to bind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 6. This much being said for the
binding power of that oath of the church of
Scotland, let us now consider what shifts
our opposites use to elude our argument
which we draw from the same; where, first,
there occurreth to us one ground which the
Bishop of Edinburgh doth everywhere beat
upon in the trace of this argument, taken
out of the 21st article of the Confession of
Faith, wherein we find these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not
that we think that any policy and an order
in ceremonies can be appointed for all ages,
times, and places; for as ceremonies, such
as men have devised, are but temporal, so
may and ought they to be changed when
they foster rather superstition than that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-422">[pg 1-422]</span><a name="Pg1-422" id="Pg1-422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they edify the kirk using the same: <span class="tei tei-q">‘whereupon
the Bishop concludeth,<a id="noteref_1283" name="noteref_1283" href="#note_1283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1283</span></span></a> that none who
sware the aforesaid article could, without
breach of this oath, swear that the ceremony
of sitting at the receiving of the sacrament
could be appointed for all ages,
times, and places.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> None of us denieth that article:
we all stand to it. For that which it pronounceth
of ceremonies must be understood
of alterable circumstances, unto which the
name of ceremonies is but generally and
improperly applied, as we have showed
elsewhere;<a id="noteref_1284" name="noteref_1284" href="#note_1284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1284</span></span></a>
neither can we, for professing ourselves
bound by an oath ever to retain sitting
at the receiving of the sacrament in
this national church of Scotland, be therefore
thought to transgress the said article.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. The article speaketh of ceremonies
devised by men, whereof sitting at the
sacrament is none, being warranted (as hath
been showed) by Christ's own example, and
not by man's device.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The article speaketh of such ceremonies
as rather foster superstition than edify
the church using the same; whereas it is
well known that sitting at the communion
did never yet foster superstition in this
church; so that the Bishop did very unadvisedly
reckon sitting at the communion
among those ceremonies whereof the article
speaketh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 7. But the Bishop hath a further
aim, and attempteth no less than both to
put the blot of perjury off himself and his
fellows, and likewise to rub it upon us, telling
us,<a id="noteref_1285" name="noteref_1285" href="#note_1285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1285</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“That no man did by the oath oblige
himself to obey and defend that part
of discipline which concerneth these alterable
things all the days of his life, but only
that discipline which is unchangeable and
commanded in the word. Yea (saith he), we
further affirm, that every man who sware to
the discipline of the church in general, by
virtue of the oath standeth obliged, not only
to obey and defend the constitution of the
church that was in force at the time of
making his oath, but also to obey and defend
whatsoever the church thereafter hath
ordained, or shall ordain, &amp;c., whether
thereby the former constitution be established
or altered,”</span> &amp;c. The same answer
doth Dr Forbesse also return us.<a id="noteref_1286" name="noteref_1286" href="#note_1286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1286</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-423">[pg 1-423]</span><a name="Pg1-423" id="Pg1-423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Here is a manifest contradiction;
for the Bishop saith that every man did, by
this oath, oblige himself only to obey and
defend that discipline which is unchangeable
and commanded in the word. And
yet again he seemeth to import (that which
Dr Forbesse plainly avoucheth<a id="noteref_1287" name="noteref_1287" href="#note_1287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1287</span></span></a>), that every
man obliged himself by the same oath to
obey and defend all that the church should
afterwards ordain, though thereby the former
constitutions be altered. The Bishop
doth, therefore, apparently contradict himself;
or, at the best, he contradicteth his
fellow-pleader for the ceremonies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That ancient discipline and policy of
this church which is contrary to the articles
of Perth, and whereunto we are bound by
the oath, was well grounded upon God's
word, and therefore should not have been
ranked among other alterable things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Whereas the Bishop is of opinion that
a man may, by his oath, tie himself to things
which a church shall afterwards ordain, he
may consider, that such an oath were unlawful,
because not sworn in judgment, Jer. iv.
2. Now this judgment which is required as
one of the inseparable companions of a lawful
oath, is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">executio justitiae</span></span>, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judicium
discretionis</span></span>, as Thomas teacheth;<a id="noteref_1288" name="noteref_1288" href="#note_1288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1288</span></span></a>
whom Bullinger and Zanchius<a id="noteref_1289" name="noteref_1289" href="#note_1289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1289</span></span></a> do herein
follow. But there is no judgment of discretion
in his oath who swears to that he knows
not what, even to that which may fall out as
readily wrong as right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Whereas the Bishop and the Doctor
allege that every man who sware to the discipline
of this church standeth obliged to
obey all that the church ordained afterward,
they greatly deceive themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. The discipline spoken of in the
promissory part of the oath must be the
same which was spoken of in the assertory
part. Now that which is mentioned in
the assertory part cannot be imagined to be
any other but that which was then presently
used in this church at the time of giving the
oath; for an assertory oath<a id="noteref_1290" name="noteref_1290" href="#note_1290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1290</span></span></a> is either of that
which is past or of that which is present:
and the assertory part of the oath whereof
we speak was not of any discipline past and
away, therefore of that which was present.
Moreover, Thomas<a id="noteref_1291" name="noteref_1291" href="#note_1291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1291</span></span></a> doth rightly put this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-424">[pg 1-424]</span><a name="Pg1-424" id="Pg1-424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
difference betwixt an assertory and a promissory
oath, that the matter of a promissory
oath is a thing to come, which is alterable,
as concerning the event. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Materia
autem juramenti assertorii, quod est de
praeterito vel praesenti, in quandam necessitatem
jam transiit, et immutabilis facta
est.</span></span> Since, then, the discipline spoken of in
the assertory part was no other than that
which was used in this church when the
oath was sworn; and since the promissory
part is illative upon, and relative unto the
matter of the assertory part; therefore we
conclude the discipline spoken of in the promissory
part could be no other than that
which was then presently used in this church
at the swearing of the oath.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Since the doctrine mentioned in that
oath is said to have been professed openly
by the King's Majesty, and the whole body
of this realm, before the swearing of the
same, why should we not likewise understand
the discipline mentioned in the oath
to be that which was practised in this realm
before the swearing of the same?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. This is further proved by the word
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">continuing</span></em>. We are sworn to continue in
the obedience of the doctrine and discipline
of this church; but how can men be said to
continue in the obedience of any other discipline
than that which they have already
begun to obey? This the Bishop seems to
have perceived, for he speaks only of defending
and obeying, but not of continuing
to obey, which is the word of the oath, and
which proveth the discipline there spoken of
and sworn to to be no other than that which
was practised in the church when the oath
was sworn. 4. Whilst we hold that he who
sweareth to the present discipline of a
church, is not by virtue of this oath obliged
to obey all which that church shall ordain
afterward, both the school and the canon
law do speak for us. The school teacheth,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">canonicus qui jurat se servaturum
statuta edita in aliquo collegio, non tenetur
ex juramenta ad servandum futura</span></span>;<a id="noteref_1292" name="noteref_1292" href="#note_1292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1292</span></span></a>
the canon law judgeth, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qui jurat servare

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 8. But we are more fully to consider
that ground whereby the Bishop thinketh to
purge himself, and those of his sect, of the
breach of the oath. He still allegeth,<a id="noteref_1294" name="noteref_1294" href="#note_1294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1294</span></span></a> that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-425">[pg 1-425]</span><a name="Pg1-425" id="Pg1-425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the points of discipline for which we contend
are not contained in the matter of the
oath. Now, as touching the discipline of
this church which is spoken of in the oath,
he questioneth what is meant by it.<a id="noteref_1295" name="noteref_1295" href="#note_1295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1295</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Put the case, it were doubtful
and questionable what is meant by the word
discipline in the oath; yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pars tutior</span></span> were
to be chosen. The Bishop nor no man
among us can certainly know, that the discipline
meant and spoken of in the oath by
those that swear it, comprehendeth not
under it those points of discipline which we
now contend, and which this church had in
use at the swearing of the oath. Shall we,
then, put the breach of the oath in a fair
hazard? God forbid; for, as Joseph Hall<a id="noteref_1296" name="noteref_1296" href="#note_1296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1296</span></span></a>
noteth from the example of Joshua and the
princes, men may not trust to shifts for the
eluding of an oath. Surely the fear of
God's name should make us tremble at an
oath, and to be far from adventuring upon
any such shifts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Bishop doth but needlessly question
what is meant by the discipline whereof
the oath speaketh; for howsoever in ecclesiastical
use it signify oftentimes that policy
which standeth in the censuring of manners,
yet in the oath it must be taken in the
largest sense, namely, for the whole policy
of the church; for, 1. The whole policy of
this church did at that time go under the
name of discipline;<a id="noteref_1297" name="noteref_1297" href="#note_1297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1297</span></span></a> and those two books
wherein this policy is contained were called
The Books of Discipline. And, without all
doubt, they who sware the oath meant by
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discipline</span></em> that whole policy of the church
which is contained in those books. Howbeit
(as the preface of them showeth) discipline
doth also comprehend other ecclesiastical
ordinances and constitutions which are
not inserted in them. 2. Doctrine and discipline,
in the oath, do comprehend all that
to which the church required, and we promised,
to perform obedience; therefore the
whole policy of the church was meant by
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discipline</span></em>, forasmuch as it was not comprehended
under doctrine.

whereby he thinketh to seclude
from the matter of the oath that policy and
discipline which we plead for.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-426">[pg 1-426]</span><a name="Pg1-426" id="Pg1-426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, he saith, that the matter of the
oath is the doctrine and discipline revealed
to the world by the gospel, and that this
limitation excludeth all ecclesiastical constitutions
which are not expressly or by a necessary
consequence contained in the written
word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That the matter of the oath is the
doctrine and discipline which is received,
believed and defended, by many notable
churches, &amp;c., and that this limitation excludeth
all these things wherein the church
of Scotland hath not the consent of many
notable churches, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. That the doctrine and discipline which
is the matter of the oath, is particularly
expressed in the Confession of Faith, &amp;c.,
and that in this confession of faith, established
by parliament, there is no mention
made of the articles controverted, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> I might here show how he confoundeth
the preaching of the evangel with
the written word; likewise how falsely he
affirmeth, that the points of discipline for
which we plead, are neither warranted by
the Scripture nor by the consent of many
notable churches. But to the point: These
words of the oath, <span class="tei tei-q">“We believe, &amp;c., that
this is the only true Christian faith and religion,
pleasing God, and bringing salvation
to man, which now is by the mercy of God
revealed to the world by the preaching of
the blessed evangel, and received, believed
and defended, by many and sundry notable
kirks and realms, but chiefly by the kirk of
Scotland, the King's Majesty, and three
Estates, &amp;c., as more particularly expressed
in the Confession of our Faith, &amp;c.,”</span> are altogether
perverted by the Bishop; for there
is no discipline spoken of in these words, but
afterward. Why, then, talks he of a discipline
revealed to the world by the gospel,
having the consent of many notable churches,
and expressed in the Confession of Faith?
And if the Bishop will have any discipline
to be meant of in these words, he must comprehend
it under the Christian faith and
religion, which bringeth salvation unto man.
But this he cannot do with so much as the
least show of reason. Thus put we an end
to the argument taken from the oath of
God, wishing every man amongst us, out of
the fear of God's glorious and fearful name,
duly to regard and ponder the same.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 1. That the ceremonies are not
indifferent to us, or such things as we may
freely practise, we prove yet by other
reasons:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. They who plead for the indifferency
of the ceremonies must tell us whether
they call them indifferent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu signato</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu exercito</span></span>; or in both these
respects. Now, we have proven,<a id="noteref_1299" name="noteref_1299" href="#note_1299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1299</span></span></a> that there
is no action deliberated upon, and wherein
we proceed with the advice of reason, which
can be indifferent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu exercito</span></span>, and that
because it cannot choose, but either have all
the circumstances which it should have (and
so be good), or else want some of them, one
or more (and so be evil). And for the indifferency
of the ceremonies <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu signato</span></span>,
though we should acknowledge it
(which we do not), yet it could be no warrant
for the practice of them, or else the
believing Gentiles might have freely eaten
of all meats, notwithstanding of the scandal
of the Jews, for the eating of all meats freely
was still a thing indifferent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu signato</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sect.</span></span> 2. The ceremonies are not indifferent
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span>, that they are prescribed and
commended unto us as indifferent; for, as
Aquinas<a id="noteref_1300" name="noteref_1300" href="#note_1300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1300</span></span></a> resolveth out of Isidore, every human
or positive law must be both <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">necessaria
ad remotionem malorum</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">utilis ad consecutionem
bonorum</span></span>. The guides of God's
church have not power to prescribe any
other thing than that which is good and
profitable for edifying; for they are set not
as lords over Christ's inheritance, but as ministers
for their good: <span class="tei tei-q">“It seemed good to
the Holy Ghost and to us, (say the apostles
and elders to the churches,) to lay upon
you no greater burden than these necessary
things,”</span> Acts xv. 28. They would not,
you see, have enacted a canon about those
things, howbeit indifferent in their own nature,
had they not found them necessary for
the eschewing of scandal. And as for the
civil magistrate, he also hath not power
to prescribe any thing which he pleaseth,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page1-428">[pg 1-428]</span><a name="Pg1-428" id="Pg1-428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though it be in itself indifferent; <span class="tei tei-q">“for he is
the minister of God unto thee for good,”</span>
saith the Apostle, Rom. xiii. 4. Mark that
word, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for good</span></em>,—it lets us see that the
magistrate hath not power given him to
enjoin any other thing than that which may
be for our good. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non enim sua causa dominantur</span></span>,
saith Calvin;<a id="noteref_1301" name="noteref_1301" href="#note_1301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1301</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sed publico bono;
neque effroeni potentia proediti sunt, sed
quoe subditorum saluti sit obstricta</span></span>. Now,
the first and chief good which the magistrate
is bound to see for unto the subjects,
is (as Pareus showeth<a id="noteref_1302" name="noteref_1302" href="#note_1302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1302</span></span></a>), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum spirituale</span></span>.
Let us, then, either see the good of the ceremonies,
or else we must account them to
be such things as God never gave princes
nor pastors power to enjoin; for howsoever
they have power to prescribe many things
which are indifferent, that is to say, neither
good nor evil in their general nature, yet
they may not command us to practise any
thing which in the particular use of it is not
necessary or expedient for some good end.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The ceremonies are not indifferent,
because, notwithstanding that they are prescribed
and commended unto us as things
in themselves indifferent, yet we are by the
will and authority of men compelled and
necessitated to use them. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Si vero ad res

to conform, and like the idolatrous Papists,
whereas it is not lawful to symbolise with
idolaters, or to be like them in a ceremony
of man's devising, or anything which hath
no necessary use in religion; such a distance
and a dissimilitude there is required to be
betwixt the church of Christ and the synagogue
of Satan; betwixt the temple of God
and the kingdom of the beast; betwixt the
company of sound believers and the conventicles
of heretics who are without; betwixt
the true worshippers of God and the worshippers
of idols, that we cannot, without
being accessory to their superstitious and
false religion, and partaking with the same,
appear conform unto them in their unnecessary
rites and ceremonies. Durandus tells
us,<a id="noteref_1324" name="noteref_1324" href="#note_1324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1324</span></span></a> that they call Easter by the Greek and
not by the Hebrew name, and that they
keep not that feast upon the same day with
the Jews, and all for this cause, lest they
should seem to Judaise. How much more
reason have we to abstain from the ceremonies
of the church of Rome lest we seem to
Romanise! But I say no more in this

thing is found, that I know of. That place, 1 Cor. v., takes not hold of my conscience
for excommunication, and I admire that Matt. xviii. so should upon any; yet these two are
the common places on which are erected the chiefest acts of ruling. And when I see not
an institution, nor any one act of government in the whole Bible performed, how can it be

I have before touched this purpose in
the third branch of the third application of
my second doctrine; and did, in my sermon
in the Abbey church, express my
thoughts of it at some length. But as I
was then unwilling to fall upon such a controversy
so publicly, and especially in a
Fast sermon, if that which I intend to examine
had not been as publicly and upon
the like occasion delivered; so now, in the
publishing, I have thought good to open my
mind concerning this thing distinctly, and
by itself. That which had been too late to
be preached after sermon is not too late to
be printed after sermon. Others (upon occasion
offered) have given their testimony
against his doctrine; and I should think
myself unfaithful in the trust put upon me,
if, upon such an occasion, I should be silent
in this business; and I believe no man will
think it strange that a piece of this nature
and strain get an answer; and I go about
it without any disrespect either to the person
or parts of my reverend brother. Only
I must give a testimony to the truth when
I hear it spoken against; and I hope his
objections have made no such impression in
any man's mind as to make him unwilling
to hear an answer. Come we therefore
to the particulars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Four rules were offered by the reverend
brother, as tending to unity, and to the
healing of the present controversies about
church government. But in truth his cure
is worse than the disease; and, instead of
making any agreement, he is like to have
his hand against every man, and every
man's hand against him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first rule was this, <span class="tei tei-q">“Establish as
few things <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span> as can well be;”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-003">[pg 2-003]</span><a name="Pg2-003" id="Pg2-003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which is, by interpretation, as little fine
gold, and as much dross as can well be.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The words of the Lord are pure words:
as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified
seven times,”</span> Psal. xii, 6. What you
take from the word of God is fine <span class="tei tei-q">“gold
tried in the fire”</span> (Rev. iii. 18); but an holy
thing of man's devising is the dross of silver.
Can he not be content to have the
dross purged from the silver except the silver
itself be cast away? The very contrary
rule is more sure and safe; which I prove
thus:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If it be a sin to diminish or take aught
from the word of God, insomuch that it
is forbidden under pain of taking away a
man's part out of the book of life, and out
of the holy city; then as many things are
to be established <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span> as can well
be. But it is a sin to diminish or take
aught from the word of God, insomuch that
it is forbidden under pain of taking away a
man's part out of the book of life, and out
of the holy city; therefore as many things
are to be established <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span> as can
well be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be remembered, withal, 1. That
the question is not now, Whether this or
that form of church government be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure
divino</span></span>; but, Whether a church government
be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>; whether Jesus
Christ hath thus far revealed his will in
his word, that there are to be church-censures,
and those to be dispensed by church-officers.
The brother is for the negative of
this question. 2. Neither is it stood upon
by any, so far as I know, that what the
Parliament shall establish concerning church
government must be established by them
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span> If the Parliament shall, in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-004">[pg 2-004]</span><a name="Pg2-004" id="Pg2-004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
parliamentary and legislative way, establish
that thing which really, and in itself, is agreeable
to the word of God, though they
do not declare it to be the will of Jesus
Christ, I am satisfied, and, I am confident,
so are others. This I confess, That it is
incumbent to parliament-men, to ministers,
and to all other Christians, according to
their vocation and interest, to search the
Scriptures, and thereby to inform their own
and other men's consciences, so as they may
do in faith what they do in point of church
government, that is, that they may know
they are not sinning, but doing the will of
God. And it ought to be no prejudice nor
exception against a form of church government
that many learned and godly divines
do assert it from Scripture to be the will of
God. And why should <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span> be
such a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">noli me tangere</span></span>? The reason was
given. <span class="tei tei-q">“This was the only thing that hindered
union in the Assembly (saith he).
Two parties came biassed. The reverend
commissioners from Scotland were for the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span> of the presbyterial, the Independents
for the congregational government.
How should either move? where should
both meet?”</span> If it was thus, how shall he
make himself blameless, who made union in
the Assembly yet more difficult, because he
came biassed a third way, with the Erastian
tenets? And where he asketh where
the Independents and we should meet, I
answer, In holding a church government
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>, that is, that the pastors and
elders ought to suspend or excommunicate
(according to the degree of the offence)
scandalous sinners. Who can tell but the
purging of the church from scandals, and
the keeping of the ordinances pure (when it
shall be actually seen to be the great thing
endeavoured on both sides), may make union
between us and the Independents more easy
than many imagine. As for his exceptions
against us who are commissioners from the
church of Scotland, I thank God it is but
such, yea, not so much, as the Arminians
did object<a id="noteref_1330" name="noteref_1330" href="#note_1330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1330</span></span></a> against the
foreign divines who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-005">[pg 2-005]</span><a name="Pg2-005" id="Pg2-005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
came to the Synod of Dort. They complained
that those divines were pre-engaged
and biassed, in regard of the judgment of
those churches from which they came; and
that therefore they did not help, but hinder,
union in that assembly. And might
not the Arians have thus excepted against
Alexander, who was engaged against them
before he came to the Council of Nice?
Might not the Nestorians have made the
same exception against Cyril, because he
was under an engagement against them before
he came to the Council of Ephesus?
Nay, had not the Jewish zealots the very
same objection to make against Paul and
Barnabas, who were engaged, not in the behalf
of one nation, but of all the churches
of the Gentiles, against the imposition of
the Mosaical rites, and had so declared
themselves at Antioch before they came to
the synod at Jerusalem? Acts xv. 2. It is
not faulty to be engaged for the truth, but
against the truth. It is not blameworthy,
but praiseworthy, to hold fast so much as
we have already attained unto. Notwithstanding
we, for our part, have also from
the beginning professed, <span class="tei tei-q">“That we are
most willing to hear and learn from the
word of God what needeth further to be
reformed in the church of Scotland.”</span><a id="noteref_1331" name="noteref_1331" href="#note_1331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1331</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second rule which was offered in
that sermon was this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let all precepts,
held out as divine institutions, have clear
scriptures,”</span> &amp;c.; <span class="tei tei-q">“Let the Scripture speak
expressly,”</span> saith he. I answer: The Scripture
speaks in that manner which seemed
fittest to the wisdom of God; that is, so as
it must cost us much searching of the Scripture,
as men search for a hid treasure, before
we find out what is the good, and acceptable,
and perfect will of God concerning
the government of his church. Will any
divine in the world deny that it is a divine
truth which, by necessary consequence, is
drawn from Scripture, as well as that which,
in express words and syllables, is written in
Scripture? Are not divers articles of our
profession,—for instance, the baptism of infants,—necessarily
and certainly proved from
Scripture, although it makes no express mention
thereof in words and syllables? But let
us hear what he hath said concerning some
scriptures (for he names but two of them)
upon which the acts of spiritual or ecclesiastical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-006">[pg 2-006]</span><a name="Pg2-006" id="Pg2-006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
government have been grounded.
<span class="tei tei-q">“That place, 1 Cor. v., takes not hold
(saith he) on my conscience for excommunication,
and I admire that Matt. xviii. so
should upon any.”</span> It is strange that he
should superciliously pass them over without
respect to so great a cloud of witnesses in
all the reformed churches, or without so
much as offering any answer at all to the
arguments which so many learned and godly
divines of old and of late have drawn from
these places for excommunication; which,
if he had done, he should not want a reply.
In the meantime, he intermixeth a politic
consideration into this debate of divine
right. <span class="tei tei-q">“I could never yet see (saith he)
how two co-ordinate governments, exempt
from superiority and inferiority, can be in
one state.”</span> I suppose he hath seen the
co-ordinate governments of a general and
of an admiral; or, if we shall come lower,
the government of parents over their children,
and masters over their servants, though
it fall often out, that he who is subject to
one man as his master, is subject to another
man as his father. In one ship there may
be two co-ordinate governments, the captain
governing the soldiers, the master governing
the mariners. In these and such like cases you
have two co-ordinate governments, when the
one governor is not subordinate to the other.
There is more subordination in the ministers
and other church-officers towards the
civil magistrate. For the minister of Christ
must be in subjection to the magistrate;
and if he be not, he is punishable by the
law of the land as well as any other subject.
The persons and estates of church-officers,
and all that they have in this world,
are subject to civil authority. But that which
is Christ's, and not ours, the royal prerogative
of the King of saints, in governing of
his church according to his own will, is not
subject to the pleasure of any man living.
But the reverend brother might well have
spared this. It is not the independency
of the church government upon the civil
government which he intended to speak against,
it is the very thing itself, a church
government, as is manifest by his other two
rules.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I come therefore to his next, which is
the third rule: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lay no more burden of
government upon the shoulders of ministers
than Christ hath plainly laid upon them.”</span>
He means none at all, as is manifest not
only by his fourth rule, where he saith that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-007">[pg 2-007]</span><a name="Pg2-007" id="Pg2-007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he finds no institution of other governments
beside magistracy, but also by the next
words, <span class="tei tei-q">“The ministers have other work to
do (saith he), and such as will take up the
whole man.”</span> He might have added this
one word more, that without the power of
church government, when ministers have
done all that ever they can, they shall not
keep themselves nor the ordinances from
pollution. Before I proceed any farther,
let it be remembered, when he excludes
ministers from government: First, It is
from spiritual or ecclesiastical government,
for the question is not of civil government.
Secondly, He excludes ruling elders too,
and therefore ought to have mentioned
them with the ministers as those who are to
draw the same yoke together, rather than
to tell us of an <span class="tei tei-q">“innate enmity between the
clergy and the laity.”</span> The keeping up of
the names of the clergy and laity savoureth
more of a domineering power than anything
the brother can charge upon presbyteries.
It is a point of controversy between Bellarmine<a id="noteref_1332" name="noteref_1332" href="#note_1332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1332</span></span></a>
and those that write against him; he
holding up, and they crying down those
names, because the Christian people are the
κλῆρος, the heritage of the Lord as well
as the ministers. Thus much by the way of
that distinction of names; and, for the thing
itself, to object an innate enmity between
the ministers of the gospel and those that
are not ministers, is no less than a dishonouring
and aspersing of the Christian religion.
To return, you see his words tend to
the taking away of all church government
out of the hands of church-officers. Now
may we know his reasons? He fetcheth the
ground of an argument out of his own
heart: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have a heart (saith he) that
knows better how to be governed than govern.”</span>
I wish his words might hold true
in a sense of pliableness and yielding to government.
How he knows to govern I
know not; but it should seem in this particular
he knows not how to be governed;
for after both houses of parliament have
concluded <span class="tei tei-q">“that many particular congregations
shall be under one presbyterial government,”</span>
he still acknowledgeth no such thing
as presbyterial government. I dare be bold
to say he is the first divine, in all the Christian
world, that ever advised a state to give
no government to church-officers, after the
state had resolved to establish presbyterian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-008">[pg 2-008]</span><a name="Pg2-008" id="Pg2-008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
government; but let us take the strength of
his argument as he pretendeth it. He
means not of an humble pliableness and
subjection (for that should ease him from his
fear of an ambitious ensnarement, and so
were contrary to his intention), but of a sinful
infirmity and ambition in the heart,
which makes it fitter for him and others to
be kept under the yoke than to govern.
And thus his argumentation runs: <span class="tei tei-q">“Might
I measure others by myself, and I know not
why I may not (God fashions men's hearts
alike; and as in water face answers face, so
the heart of man to man), I ingenuously
profess I have a heart that knows better
how to be governed than govern,—I fear an
ambitious ensnarement, and I have cause,—I
see what raised Prelacy and Papacy to
such a height,”</span> &amp;c. The two scriptures will
not prove what he would. The first of
them, Psal. xxxiii. 15, <span class="tei tei-q">“He fashioneth their
hearts alike,”</span> gives him no ground at all,
except it be the homonomy of the English
word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alike</span></span>, which in this place noteth nothing
else but τὸ καθόλου,—all men's hearts
are alike in this, that God fashioneth them
all, and therefore knoweth them all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">æque</span></span>
or alike (that is the scope of the place).
The Hebrew <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jachad</span></span> is used in the same
sense, Ezra iv. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“We ourselves together
will build;”</span><a id="noteref_1333" name="noteref_1333" href="#note_1333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1333</span></span></a>
they mean not they will all
build in the like fashion, or in the same
manner, but that they will build all of them
together, one as well as another; so Psal.
ii. 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“The rulers take counsel together;”</span>
Jer. xlvi. 12, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are fallen both together.”</span>
The other place, Prov. xxvii. 19, if
you take it word by word as it is in the Hebrew,
is thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“As in water faces to faces;
so the heart of man to man.”</span> Our translators
add the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">answereth</span></span>, but the Hebrew
will suffer the negative reading, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As
in water faces answer not to faces</span></span>. The
Septuagint reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“As faces are not like
faces, so neither are the hearts of men alike.”</span>
The Chaldee paraphrase thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“As waters
and as countenances, which are not like one
another, so the hearts of the sons of men are
not alike.”</span> Thus doth Mr Cartwright, in
his judicious commentary, give the sense:
<span class="tei tei-q">“As in the water face doth not answer fully
to face, but in some sort, so there may be a
conjecture, but no certain knowledge of the
heart of man.”</span> But let the text be read affirmatively,
not negatively, what shall be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-009">[pg 2-009]</span><a name="Pg2-009" id="Pg2-009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sense? Some take it thus:<a id="noteref_1334" name="noteref_1334" href="#note_1334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1334</span></span></a> A man's
heart may be someway seen in his countenance
as a face in the water. Others<a id="noteref_1335" name="noteref_1335" href="#note_1335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1335</span></span></a>
thus: As a face in the water is various and
changeable to him that looketh upon it, so
is the heart of man inconstant to a friend
that trusteth in him. Others<a id="noteref_1336" name="noteref_1336" href="#note_1336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1336</span></span></a> thus: As a
man seeth his own face in the water, so he
may see himself in his own heart or conscience.
Others<a id="noteref_1337" name="noteref_1337" href="#note_1337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1337</span></span></a> thus: As face answereth
face in the water, so he that looketh for a
friendly affection from others, must show it
in himself. It will never be proved that
any such thing is intended in that place as
may warrant this argumentation. There is
a particular corruption in one man's
heart—for instance, ambition—which makes
him unfit to be trusted with government;
therefore the same corruption is in all other
men's hearts; even as the face in the water
answereth the face out of the water so just,
that there is not a spot or blemish in the
one but it is in the other. I am sure Paul
taught us not so when he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“In lowliness
of mind let each esteem other better
than themselves,”</span> Phil. ii. 3. Nay, the
brother himself hath taken off the edge of
his own argument (if it had any) in his epistle
printed before his sermon, where, speaking
of his brethren, from whose judgment
he dissenteth in point of government, he
hath these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whose wisdom and humility
(I speak it confidently) may safely
be trusted with as large a share of government
as they themselves desire.”</span> Well,
but suppose now the same corruption to be
in other men's hearts, that they are in great
danger of an ambitious ensnarement if they
be trusted with government, is this corruption
only in the hearts of ministers, or is
it in the hearts of all other men? I suppose
he will say, in all men's hearts, and
then his argument will conclude against all
civil government. Last of all, Admit that
there be just fears of abusing the power and
government ecclesiastical,—let the persons
to be intrusted with it be examined, and the
power itself bounded according to the strictest
rules of Christ. Let abuses be prevented,
reformed, corrected. The abuse cannot
take away the use where the thing itself is
necessary. Why might he not have satisfied
himself without speaking against the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-010">[pg 2-010]</span><a name="Pg2-010" id="Pg2-010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thing itself? Once, indeed, he seemeth to
recoil, and saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Only I would have it so
bounded, that it might be said, Hitherto
shalt thou come, and here shalt thou stay
thy proud waves,”</span> yet by and by he passeth
his own bounds, and totally renounceth the
government to the civil power, which I
shall speak to anon. But I must first ask,
Whence is this fear of the proud swelling
waves of presbyterial government? Where
have they done hurt? Was it upon the
coast of France, or upon the coast of Holland,
or upon the coast of Scotland, or where
was it? Or was it the dashing upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
in cognita</span></span>? He that would forewarn men
to beware of presbyterial usurpations (for so
the brother speaking to the present controversy
about church government must be apprehended),
and to make good what he saith
falls upon the stories of Pope Paul V., and
of the Bishop of Canterbury, is not a little
wide from the mark. I should have expected
some examples of evils and mischiefs
which presbyterial government hath brought
upon other reformed churches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well, the reverend brother hath not done,
but he proceedeth thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“It was the king
of Sodom's speech to Abraham, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Give me
the persons, take thou the goods;’</span> so say I,
Give us doctrine, take you the government:
as is said, Right Honourable, give me leave
to make this request in the behalf of the
ministry. Give us two things and we shall
do well: 1. Give us learning; and, 2. Give
us a competency.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This calls to mind a story which Clemens
Alexandrinus tells us:<a id="noteref_1338" name="noteref_1338" href="#note_1338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1338</span></span></a> When one had painted
Helena with much gold, Apolles, looking
upon it, <span class="tei tei-q">“Friend (saith he), when you could
not make her fair, you have made her rich.”</span>
Learning and competency do enrich. The
Jesuits have enough of both, but that which
maketh a visible ministerial church to be
<span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful as Tizrah, comely as Jerusalem,”</span>
that which maketh fair the outward face of
a church, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">government</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discipline</span></em>, the
removing of scandals, the preserving of the
ordinances from pollution. He had spoken
more for the honour of God and for the
power of godliness, if he had said this in
the behalf of the ministry: It were better
for us to want competency and helps to
learning, than to partake with other men's
sins, by admitting the scandalous and profane
to the Lord's table. His way, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-011">[pg 2-011]</span><a name="Pg2-011" id="Pg2-011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he adviseth, will perhaps <span class="tei tei-q">“get us an able
ministry, and procure us honour enough,”</span>
as he speaketh; but, sure, it can neither preserve
the purity, nor advance the power of
religion, because it putteth no black mark
upon profaneness and scandal in church-members
more than in any others. The
king of Sodom's speech cannot serve his
turn except it be turned over, and then it
will serve him as just as anything, thus:
Give us the goods, take you the persons (or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the souls</span></em>, as the Hebrew and the Chaldee
hath it); <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us a competency,”</span> saith he,—here
he asketh the goods,—<span class="tei tei-q">“take you the
government,”</span>—here he quitteth the persons
or souls to be governed only by the civil
power. However, as at that time Abraham
would take nothing that was not his
own, insomuch as he answereth the king of
Sodom: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not take from a thread
even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not
take anything that is thine,”</span> Gen. xiv. 23;
so this Parliament, I trust, shall be so
counselled and guided of the Lord, that
they will leave to the church what is the
church's, or rather to Christ what is Christ's.
And as Abraham had lift up his hand to
the most high God to do that (ver. 32), so
have the Honourable Houses, with hands lift
up to the most high God, promised to do
this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now, seeing I have touched upon
the covenant, I wish the reverend brother
may seriously consider whether he hath not
violated the oath of God in advising the
Parliament to lay no burden of government
upon church-officers, but to take the government
of the church wholly into their
own hands. In the first article of the
solemn league and covenant, there is thrice
mention made of the government of the
church; and namely, That we shall endeavour
the reformation of religion in the
kingdoms of England and Ireland, in doctrine,
worship, discipline, and government,
according to the word of God, and the
example of the best reformed churches.
Where observe,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The extirpation of church government
is not the reformation of it. The
second article is indeed of things to be extirpated;
but this of things to be preserved
and reformed. Therefore as by the covenant
Prelacy was not to be reformed, but
to be abolished, so, by the same covenant,
church government was not to be abolished,
but to be reformed.

2. Church government is mentioned in
the covenant as a spiritual, not a civil
thing. The matters of religion are put
together—doctrine, worship, discipline, and
government; the privileges of Parliament
come after, in the third article.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. That clause, <span class="tei tei-q">“According to the word
of God,”</span> implieth, that the word of God
holdeth forth such light unto us as may
guide and direct us in the reformation of
church government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. And will the brother say that the
example of the best reformed churches
leadeth us his way; that is, to have no
church government at all distinct from the
civil government?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And so much concerning his third rule.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourth was this: <span class="tei tei-q">“A Christian magistrate,
as a Christian magistrate, is a governor
in the church.”</span> And who denieth
this? The question is, Whether there ought
to be no other government in the church
beside that of the Christian magistrate.
That which he driveth at is, That the
Christian magistrate should leave no power
of spiritual censures to the elderships. He
would have the magistrate to do like the
rich man in the parable, who had exceeding
many flocks and herds, and yet did
take away the little ewe-lamb from the
poor man, who had nothing save that.
The brother saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Of other governments
besides magistracy, I find no institution; of
them I do, Rom. xiii. 1, 2.”</span> I am sorry
he sought no better, else he had found
more. Subjection and obedience is commanded,
as due not only to civil but to
spiritual governors, to those that are over
us in the Lord, 1 Thess. v. 12; so, 1 Tim.
v. 17, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let the elders that rule well be
counted worthy of double honour;”</span> Heb.
xiii. 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“Remember them which have the
rule over you, who have spoken unto you
the word of God;”</span> ver. 17, <span class="tei tei-q">“Obey them
that have the rule over you, and submit
yourselves; for they watch for your souls.”</span>
And what understandeth he by <span class="tei tei-q">“he that
ruleth,”</span> Rom. xii. 8? If the judgment of
Gualther and Bullinger have any weight
with him (as I suppose it hath) they do not
there exclude, but take in, under that word,
the ruling officers of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But now, in the close, let the reverend
brother take heed he hath not split upon a
rock, and taken from the magistrate more
than he hath given him. He saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian
magistrates are to manage their office
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-013">[pg 2-013]</span><a name="Pg2-013" id="Pg2-013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under Christ, and for Christ. Christ hath
placed governments in his church, 1 Cor.
xii. 28, &amp;c. I find all government given
to Christ, and to Christ as Mediator (I desire
all to consider it), Eph. i. 3, 23, and
Christ, as Head of these, given to the
church.”</span> If this be good divinity, then I
am sure it will be the hardest task which
ever he took in hand to uphold and assert
the authority either of pagan or Christian
magistrates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, He lets the pagan or infidel magistrate
fall to the ground, as an usurper
who hath no just title to reign, because all
government is given to Christ, and to him
as Mediator. But which way was the authority
of government derived from Christ,
and from him as Mediator, to a pagan
prince or emperor?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next, He will make it to fare little better
with the Christian magistrate. For if
the Christian magistrate be the vicegerent
of Christ, and of Christ as Mediator; and
if he be to manage his office under, and for
Christ,—then the reverend brother must
either prove from Scripture, that Christ,
as Mediator, hath given such a commission
of vicegerentship and deputyship to the
Christian magistrate; or otherwise, acknowledge
that he hath given a most dangerous
wound to magistracy, and made it an empty
title, claiming that power which it hath no
warrant to assume.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God and nature hath made magistrates,
and given them great authority; but from
Christ as Mediator they have it not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I find in Scripture, that church-officers
have their power from Christ as Mediator;
and they are to manage their office under
and for Christ; and in the name of the
Lord Jesus Christ do we assemble ourselves
together, Matt. xviii. 20; in his name do
we preach, Luke xxiv. 47; Acts iv. 17, 18;
v. 28, 41; ix. 27; in his name do we baptise,
Acts ii. 38; iv. 12, 16; xix. 5; in his
name do we excommunicate, 1 Cor. v. 5.
But I do not find in Scripture that the
magistrate is to rule, or to make laws, or to
manage any part of his office in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as the Mediator
hath not anywhere given such a commission
and power to the magistrate, so, as
Mediator, he had it not to give; for he
was not made a judge in civil affairs, Luke
xii. 14, and his kingdom is not of this world,
John xviii. 36. How can that power which
Christ as Mediator hath not received of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-014">[pg 2-014]</span><a name="Pg2-014" id="Pg2-014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Father be derived from Christ to the Christian
magistrate? I know that Christ, as he
is the eternal Son of God, and <span class="tei tei-q">“thought it
no robbery to be equal with God,”</span> doth,
with the Father and the Holy Ghost, reign
and rule over all the kingdoms of the sons
of men. He that is Mediator, being God,
hath, as God, all power in heaven and earth
(and this power was given to him, Matt.
xxviii. 18, both by the eternal generation,
and by the declaration of him to be the
Son of God with power, when he was raised
from the dead, Rom. i. 4, even as he is
said to be begotten, when he was raised
again, Acts xiii. 33: he had relinquished
and laid aside his divine dominion and
power when he had made himself in the
form of a servant, but after his resurrection
it is gloriously manifested), and so he that
is Mediator, being God, hath power to subdue
his and his church's enemies, and to
make his foes his footstool. But as Mediator
he is only the church's King, Head,
and Governor, and hath no other kingdom.
The Photinians have defined the kingly
office of Christ thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is an office committed
to him by God, to govern, with the
highest authority and power, all creatures
endued with understanding, and especially
men, and the church gathered of them.”</span><a id="noteref_1339" name="noteref_1339" href="#note_1339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1339</span></span></a>
But those that have written against them
have corrected their definition in this particular,
because Christ is properly King of
his church only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for those two scriptures which the
brother citeth, they are extremely misapplied.
He citeth 1 Cor. xii. 28 to prove
that Christ hath placed civil governments
in his church. If by the governments or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-015">[pg 2-015]</span><a name="Pg2-015" id="Pg2-015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
governors there mentioned he understood
the civil magistrates, yet that place saith
not that Christ hath placed them, but that
God hath done it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next, The Apostle speaks of such governors
as the church had at that time; but at
that time the church had no godly nor
Christian magistrates. This is Calvin's argument,
whereby he proves that ecclesiastical,
not civil governors, are there meant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, I ask, How can we conceive
that civil government can come into the
catalogue of ecclesiastical and spiritual administrations?
for such are all the rest there
reckoned forth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, The brother, after second thoughts,
may think he hath done another disservice
to the magistrate, in making the magistracy
to be below and behind the ministry. The
Apostle puts them in this order: <span class="tei tei-q">“God
hath set some in the church, first apostles,
secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, after
that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
governments,”</span> &amp;c. How makes the brother
this to agree with his interpretation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next, He citeth Eph. i. 21-23, to
prove that all government is given to Christ,
and to him as Mediator; and Christ, as
Head of these, given to the church. But
this place maketh more against him than
for him; for the Apostle saith not that
Christ is given to the church as the Head
of all principalities and powers. The brother
saith so; and, in saying so, he makes
Christ a head to those that are not of his
body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Apostle saith far otherwise: That
God gave Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“to be the head over all
things to the church, which is his body;”</span>
which the Syriac readeth more plainly,—<span class="tei tei-q">“And
him who is over all he gave to be
the head to the church.”</span> He is a head to
none but the church; but He who is head
to the church <span class="tei tei-q">“is over all, God blessed for
ever,”</span> Rom. ix. 5; yea, even as a man, he
is over or above all. The very human nature
of Christ which was raised from the
dead, being set at the right hand of the
Majesty of God, is exalted to a higher degree
of honour and glory than either man
or angel ever was, or ever shall he; so that
He that is head of the church is over all,
because he doth not only excel his own
members, but excel all creatures that ever
God made. It is one thing to say that
Christ is exalted to a dignity, excellency,
pre-eminence, majesty, and glory, far above
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-016">[pg 2-016]</span><a name="Pg2-016" id="Pg2-016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all principality, and power, and might, and
dominion; another thing to say that Christ
is head of all principalities and governments,
and, as Mediator, exerciseth his
kingly office over these. The Apostle saith
the former, but not the latter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shall I need to illustrate this distinction?
Is there anything more known in the world?
Will any say that he who excels other men
in dignity, splendour, honour, and glory,
must therefore reign and rule over all those
whom he thus excels?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Apostle saith indeed, in another
sense, that Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“is the head of all principality
and power,”</span> Col. ii. 10. But that
is spoken of Christ not as he is Mediator,
but only as he is God; and the Apostle's
meaning in those words is nothing but this:
That Christ is true God, saith Tossanus;
that he is omnipotent, saith Gualther; that
he, being the natural Son of God, is together
with the Father, Lord of all things,
saith Bullinger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That this is the meaning will soon appear:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. From the scope of the place, which is
to teach the Colossians not to worship angels,
because they are but servants, and the
Son of God is their Lord and Head.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Apostle expounds himself how
Christ is the head of all principality and
power: Col. i. 15-17, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is the image
of the invisible God, the first-born of every
creature: for by him were all things created
that are in heaven, and that are in
earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers; all things were created by him, and
for him: and he is before all things, and by
him all things consist.”</span> Now all this is,
without controversy, to be understood not of
the office, but of the person of Jesus Christ;
not of his governing and kingly office, as he
is Mediator, but to prove that he is true and
very God; therefore Beza, Zanchius, Gualther,
Bullinger, Tossanus, M. Bayne, and
divers other interpreters upon the place, do
generally agree that the Apostle (ver. 15-17)
speaks of the dignity and excellency of
the person of Jesus Christ, proving him to
be true God; and that (ver. 18) he cometh
to speak of his office, as he is Mediator:
<span class="tei tei-q">“And he is the head of the body, the
church,”</span> &amp;c. So that we may distinguish a
twofold headship of Jesus Christ: One, in
regard of his Godhead,—and so he is head
of all principality and power; another, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-017">[pg 2-017]</span><a name="Pg2-017" id="Pg2-017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
regard of his office of Mediatorship,—and so
he is head of the church only. The present
question is of the latter, not of the former.
The former is common to the Son of God
with the Father and the Holy Ghost; the
latter is proper to Christ as God and man.
The former shall continue for ever; the
latter shall not continue for ever. The former
doth not necessarily suppose the latter;
but the latter doth necessarily suppose the
former. Christ can reign as God, though
he reign not as Mediator; but he cannot
reign as Mediator and not reign as God.
The object of the former is every creature;
the object of the latter is the church gathered
out of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This digression concerning the headship
of Jesus Christ may for the future prevent
divers objections, so I shall return.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now (I desire all to consider it) there
is not one word in those three last verses of
Eph. i. which will give any ground for that
which the brother with so much confidence
averreth. Ver. 21 affordeth this argument
against him: The honour and dignity of Jesus
Christ there spoken of hath place <span class="tei tei-q">“not
only in this world, but also in that which is
to come.”</span> But the kingdom and government
which is given to Christ, as Mediator,
shall not continue in the world to come
(for when Christ hath put his enemies under
his feet, he shall deliver up the kingdom
to the Father, and reign no longer as Mediator,
1 Cor. xv. 24, 25); therefore the government
given to Christ, as he is Mediator,
cannot be meant in that place, but the
dignifying, honouring, preferring, and exalting
of Christ to a higher degree of glory
than either man or angel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Come on now and see whether ver. 22
maketh any whit more for him: He <span class="tei tei-q">“hath
put all things under his feet;”</span> that is, saith
Zanchius, all things but the church, which
is his body. But this must be meant in respect
of the decree and foreknowledge of
God, as Jerome expounds the place; and so
doth the Scripture expound itself: Heb. ii.
8, <span class="tei tei-q">“But now we see not yet all things put
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-018">[pg 2-018]</span><a name="Pg2-018" id="Pg2-018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under him;”</span> 1 Cor. xv. 25, <span class="tei tei-q">“He must reign,
till he hath put all enemies under his feet;”</span>
Acts ii. 34, 35, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sit thou on my right hand,
until I make thy foes thy footstool.”</span> Now,
when Christ shall have put down all rule,
and all authority, and power, and shall put
his enemies under his feet, then he shall
cease to reign any more as Mediator (which
I have even now proved); but before that
be done he reigns as Mediator. So that it
can never be proved that the meaning of
these words, <span class="tei tei-q">“He hath put all things under
his feet,”</span> is, that all government in this
world is given to Christ as Mediator; and
whoever saith so, must needs acknowledge
that Christ's exercising of government, as
he is Mediator, over all principalities and
powers, shall continue after all things shall
be put under his feet; or that Christ shall
not govern as Mediator, <span class="tei tei-q">“till all things be
put under his feet,”</span> which is so contrary
to the Apostle's meaning, that Christ shall
then cease to reign as Mediator.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next words, <span class="tei tei-q">“And he gave him to be
the head over all things to the church,”</span>
do furnish another argument against him.
Christ's headship, and his government as
Mediator, are commensurable, and of an
equal extent. Christ is a head to none but
to his church; therefore no government is
given to him as Mediator but the government
of his church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last verse doth further confirm that
which I say; for the Apostle, continuing
his speech of the church, saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Which is
his body, the fulness of him that filleth all
in all.”</span> He calls the church Christ's fulness,
in reference to his headship, that
which makes him full and complete so far
as he is a head or king. Having his
church fully gathered, he hath his complete
kingdom, his perfect body; and this
being done, he wants nothing, so far as he
is Mediator: so that the Holy Ghost doth
here, as it were on purpose, anticipate this
opinion, lest any should think all civil government
is given to Christ as Mediator.
Though, as God, he filleth heaven and
earth, yet, as Mediator, his filling of all in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2-019">[pg 2-019]</span><a name="Pg2-019" id="Pg2-019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all extends no further than his body, his
church, which is therefore called his fulness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, To avoid the mistake of this
place, and upon the whole matter, let these
three things be well distinguished in the
Mediator Jesus Christ. 1. His ὑπεροχὴ or
δυχα, his eminence and highness in respect
of the glory and majesty he is exalted to,
far above whatsoever is highest among all
the creatures. 2. His δύναμις, the power
by which he can, and doth by degrees, and
will more and more subdue his and his
church's enemies, and dash them in pieces
like a potter's vessel, and break them with
a rod of iron. 3. His βασιλεία, his kingly
power, by which he exerciseth acts of government.
These three are distinguished
in an earthly king, the first two being of a
larger extent than the third. The conclusion
of that prayer which our Lord taught
his disciples doth distinguish the same three
in God: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thine is the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory.”</span> Now these being
distinguished in the Mediator Jesus Christ,
I conclude with these three distinct assertions
(the truth whereof I hope I have made
to appear): 1. As Mediator, he is exalted
and dignified above all creatures, and his
glory is above all the earth; 2. As Mediator,
he exerciseth acts of divine power and
omnipotence over all creatures, in the behalf
of, and for the good of his church, and
restraineth, or diverteth, or destroyeth all
his church's enemies; 3. As Mediator, he is
king, head, and governor to none but his
church: neither was all government put in
his hand, but that of the church only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I could enlarge myself further against
that most dangerous principle, <span class="tei tei-q">“That all
government, even that which is civil, is given
to Christ, and to him as Mediator;”</span> but
let these things suffice for the present. The
reverend brother's opinion will find better
entertainment among the Jews, who expect
a temporal monarchy of the Messiah; and
among Papists, who desire to uphold the
Pope's temporal authority over kings, as
Christ's vicegerent upon earth.

After that Mr Coleman had preached
and printed such doctrine as I was, in my
conscience, fully persuaded was contrary to
the covenant of the three kingdoms, and destructive
(if it were put in practice) to the
reformation of religion, he having also flatly
and publicly imputed to the Commissioners
from the church of Scotland a great part of
the fault of hindering union in the Assembly
here, I thought myself obliged in duty,
and in the trust which I bear, to give a
public testimony against his doctrine (which
others did also) upon occasion not sought, but
by divine providence, and a public calling
then offered, first for preaching, and after
for printing, in either of which I think
there did not appear the least disrespect or
bitterness towards the reverend brother.
The Lord knows my intention was to speak
to the matter, to vindicate the truth, and to
remove that impediment of reformation by
him cast in; and if he, or any man else had,
in meekness of spirit, gravely and rationally,
for clearing of truth, endeavoured to confute
me, I ought not, I should not, have taken it
ill; but now, when this piece of his against
me, called <span class="tei tei-q">“A Brotherly Examination Re-examined”</span>
(I think he would or should
have said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">examined</span></span>, for this is the first
examination of it), I find it more full of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">railing</span></em> than of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reasoning</span></em>, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gibing</span></em> than
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gravity</span></em>; and when polemics do so degenerate,
the world is abused not edified. He
tells me if I have not work enough I shall
have more. I confess the answering of this
piece is no great work; and the truth is, I
am ashamed I have so little to make answer
unto; yet I shall do my best to improve
even this work to edification. When
other work comes I wish it be work indeed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-002">[pg 3-002]</span><a name="Pg3-002" id="Pg3-002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and not words. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Res cum re, ratio cum

Sir, arguments, arguments, if there
be any: you have affirmed great things,
and new things, which you have not proved.
The assertions of such as are for a church
government <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in genere</span></span>, and for the presbyterial
government <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in specie</span></span>, are known;
their arguments are known, but your solutions
are not yet known. If Mr Prynne's
book against the suspension of scandalous
persons from the sacrament be the work
for the present which he means, I hope it
shall be in due time most satisfactorily spoken
unto, both by others and by myself.
I desire rather solid than subitane lucubrations.
In the meanwhile, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let not him

BUT CONTRADICT HIMSELF, CONCERNING
THE STATE OF THE QUESTION.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He tells us often that he doth not deny
to church officers all power of church government,
but only the corrective part of
government; that the doctrinal and declarative
power is in the ministry; see p.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-003">[pg 3-003]</span><a name="Pg3-003" id="Pg3-003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
11, 14. He denieth that he did <span class="tei tei-q">“advise
the Parliament to take church government
wholly into their own hands: I never had
it in my thoughts (saith he) that the Parliament
had power of dispensing the word and
sacraments.”</span> I must confess it is to me
new language, which I never heard before,
that the dispensing of the word and sacraments
is a part of church government; sure
the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">government</span></span> is not, nor never was,
so understood in the controversies concerning
church government. But if it be, why
did the brother in his sermon oppose doctrine
and government? <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us doctrine
(said he); take you the government.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But behold now how he doth most palpably
contradict himself, in one and the
same page; it is the 11th. <span class="tei tei-q">“I know no
such distinction of government (saith he),
ecclesiastical and civil, in the sense I take
government for the corrective part thereof;
all ecclesiastical (improperly called) government
being merely doctrinal; the corrective
or punitive part being civil or temporal.”</span>
Again, within a few lines, <span class="tei tei-q">“I do acknowledge
a presbyterian government; I said so
expressly in my epistle; and do heartily
subscribe to the votes of the house.”</span> If he
heartily subscribe to the votes and ordinances
of Parliament, then he heartily subscribeth
that elderships suspend men from
the sacrament for any of the scandals enumerate,
it being proved by witnesses upon
oath: this power is corrective, not merely
doctrinal. He must also subscribe to the
subordination of congregational, classical,
and synodical assemblies in the government
of the church, and to appeals from the
lesser to the greater, as likewise to ordination
by presbyteries. And, I pray, is all
this merely doctrinal? And will he now
subscribe heartily to all this? How will
that stand with the other passages before
cited? or with p. 17, where it being objected
to him, that he takes away from
elderships all power of spiritual censures,
his reply neither yieldeth excommunication
nor suspension, but admonition alone, and
that by the ministers who are a part of the
elderships, not by the whole eldership consistorially.
Again, p. 14, he confesseth: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
advised the Parliament to lay no burden
of government upon them, whom he, this
commissioner, thinks church officers, pastors
and ruling elders.”</span> Now I argue thus:
He that adviseth the Parliament to lay no
burden of government upon ministers and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-004">[pg 3-004]</span><a name="Pg3-004" id="Pg3-004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ruling elders, he adviseth the Parliament to
do contrary to their own votes and ordinances,
and so is far from subscribing heartily
thereunto. But Mr Coleman, by his
own confession, adviseth the Parliament to
lay no burden of government upon ministers
and ruling elders; therefore, &amp;c. How he
will reconcile himself with himself let him
look to it.

He hath not yet, though put in mind,
produced the least exception against the
known arguments for excommunication and
church government drawn from Matt, xviii.
and 1 Cor. v. He tells the affirmer is to
prove; but the affirmers have proved, and
their arguments are known (yea he himself,
p. 1, saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have had the opportunity
to hear almost what man can say in either
side,”</span> speaking of the controversy of church
government); therefore he should have made
a better answer than to say that those places
did not take hold of his conscience; yet if he
have not heard enough of those places, he
shall, I trust, ere long hear more.

He had said, I could never yet see how
two co-ordinate governments, exempt from

A general and an admiral; a father and a
master; a captain and a master of a ship.
This, p. 8, he doth not deny, nor saith one
word against it; only he endeavoureth to
make those similes to run upon four feet,
and to resemble the General Assembly and
the Parliament in every circumstance. But
I did not at all apply them to the General Assembly
and the Parliament; only I brought
them to overthrow that general thesis of his
concerning the inconsistency of two co-ordinate
governments, which, if he could defend,
why hath not he done it?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr Coleman did ground an argument
upon Psal. xxxiii. 15; Prov. xxvii. 29,
which cannot stand with the intent of the
Holy Ghost, because contrary to other
scriptures and to the truth, as I proved,
p. 38. He answereth, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>,
that my sense may stand, and his
may stand too. But if my sense may stand,
which is contrary to his, then his argument
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-006">[pg 3-006]</span><a name="Pg3-006" id="Pg3-006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had no sure ground for it; yea, that which
I said was to prove that his consequence,
drawn from those scriptures, did contradict
both the apostle Paul's doctrine and his
own profession, which still lieth upon him
since it is not answered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Page 14, He citeth 1 Cor. x. 32, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give
none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the
Gentiles, nor to the church of God,”</span> to
prove that all government is either a Jewish
government, or a church government, or
a heathenish government, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there is
no third.</span></em> Yes, Sir, yourself hath given a
third (for you have told three), but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">transeat
cum cæteris erroribus</span></span>. To the matter.
This is a perverting of scripture to prove an
untruth; for the government of generals,
admirals, majors, sheriffs, is neither a Jewish
government nor a church government,
nor a heathenish government. Neither
doth the Apostle speak anything of government
in that place. He maketh a distribution
of all men who are in danger to be
scandalised—not of governments; and if he
had applied the place rightly to the Parliament
of England, he had said, They are
either of the Jews, or of the Gentiles, or
of the church of God: and this needeth not
an answer. But when he saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
English Parliament is either a Jewish government,
or a church government, or a
heathenish government,”</span> I answer, It is
none of these, but it is a civil government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Page 15, Declaring his opinion of church
government he citeth Rom. xiii. 4, <span class="tei tei-q">“To
execute wrath upon him that doeth evil,”</span> to
prove that the punitive part belongs to the
Christian magistrate. But what is this to
the punitive part which is in controversy,—spiritual
censures, suspension from the sacraments,
deposition from the ministry, excommunication?
The punitive part spoken
of, Rom. xiii., belongeth to all civil magistrates,
whether Christian or infidel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Page 18. He maketh this reply to
1 Thess. v. 12; 1 Tim. xvii.; Heb. xiii.
7, 17: <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, man, I have found these an
hundred and an hundred times twice told,
and yet am I as I was.”</span> Why, Sir, was
the argument so ridiculous? I had brought
those places to prove another government
(and, if you will, the institution of another
government) beside magistracy, which he
said he did not find in Scripture. Here
are some who are no civil magistrates set
over the Thessalonians in the Lord, 1 Thess.
v. 12; Paul writeth to Timothy of elders
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-007">[pg 3-007]</span><a name="Pg3-007" id="Pg3-007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that rule well, 1 Tim. v. 17; the churches
of the Hebrews had some rulers who had
spoken to them the word of God, Heb. xiii.
7; rulers that watched for their souls as
they that must give an account, ver. 17.
Now let the reverend brother speak out,
What can he answer? Were these rulers
civil magistrates? Did the civil magistrate
speak to them the word of God? If
these rulers were not magistrates but ministers,
I ask next. Is it a matter of indifferency,
and no institution, to have a ministry
in a church or not? I hope, though he
do not acknowledge ruling elders <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>,
yet he will acknowledge that the ministers
of the word are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>; yet
these were some of the rulers mentioned in
the scriptures quoted. Let him loose the
knot, and laugh when he hath done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Page 19, 20, He laboureth to prove from
1 Cor. xii. 28, that Christ hath placed civil
government in his church; and whereas it is
said, that though it were granted that civil
governments are meant in that place, yet it
proves not that Christ hath placed them in
the church. He replieth, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am sure the
Commissioner will not stand to this: he that
placed governors was the same that placed
teachers.”</span> But his assurance deceiveth him;
for upon supposition that civil governments
are there meant (which is his sense), I deny
it, and he doth but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">petere principium</span></span>.
God placed civil governments, Christ placed
teachers; God placed all whom Christ placed,
but Christ did not place all whom God
placed. Next, whereas it was said, that
governments in that place cannot be meant
of Christian magistrates, because at that
time the church had no Christian magistrates,
he replieth, That Paul speaks of governments
that the church had not, because
in the enumeration, ver. 29, 30, he omits
none but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">helps</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">governments</span></em>. I answer,
The reason of that omission is not because
these two were not then in being (for
God had set them as well as the rest in the
church, ver. 28), but to make ruling elders
and deacons contented with their station,
though they be not prophets, teachers, &amp;c.
Thirdly, I asked, How comes civil government
into the catalogue of ecclesiastical and
spiritual administrations? His reply is nothing
but an affirmation, that Christian
magistracy is an ecclesiastical administration,
and a query whether working of miracles
and gifts of healings be ecclesiastical.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> Hence followeth, 1. That if the magistrate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-008">[pg 3-008]</span><a name="Pg3-008" id="Pg3-008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cease to be Christian he loseth his
administration; 2. That though a worker of
miracles cease to be Christian, yet it is a
question whether he may not still work
miracles. Lastly, Where I objected that
he puts magistracy behind ministry, he
makes no answer, but only that he may do
this as well as my rule puts the nobility of
Scotland behind the ministry. No, Sir, we
put but ruling elders behind ministers in
the order of their administrations because
the Apostle doth so. It is accidental to
the ruling elder to be of the nobility, or to
nobles to be ruling elders: there are but
some so, and many otherwise. That of placing
deacons before elders, 1 Cor. xii. 28, is
no great matter; sure the Apostle, Rom.
xii., placeth elders before deacons.

distinct from civil, except that
which is merely doctrinal; and, p. 14, he
adviseth the Parliament to take the corrective
power wholly into their own hands, and
exempteth nothing of ecclesiastical power
from their hands but the dispensing of the
word and sacraments. Hence it followeth
that there ought to be neither suspension
from the sacrament, nor excommunication,
nor ordination, nor deposition of ministers,
nor receiving of appeals, except all these
things be done by the civil magistrate. If
he say the magistrate gives leave to do
these things, I answer, 1. So doth he give
leave to preach the word and minister the
sacraments in his dominions. 2. Why doth
he then, in his sermon, and doth still, in
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>, p. 14, advise the Parliament
to lay no burden of corrective government

3. Page 9, Whereas I had said, That
without church government ministers shall

neither this keeping of themselves from pollution,

of the gospel is found unclear in such a
point. I will not give my own, but scriptural
answers to both. The former is answered,
1 Tim. v. 22, Be not <span class="tei tei-q">“partaker of
other men's sins: keep thyself pure.”</span> It
is sin to dispense ordinances to the unworthy,
whether ordination, or communion in
the sacrament. For the other, the pollution
of ordinances is the Scripture language.
I hope he means not to quarrel
at the Holy Ghost's language: Ezek. xxii.

4. Page 11, Whereas I had objected to
him, that he excludeth ruling elders as well
as ministers from government, he answers,
That ruling elders are either the same, for
office and ordination, with the minister
(which, as he thinks, the Independents
own, but not I), or they are the Christian
magistrate; and so he saith he doth not
exclude them. Mark here, he excludeth
all ruling elders from a share in church
government who are not either the same,

for office and ordination, with the minister,
or else the Christian magistrate; and so,
upon the matter, he holdeth that ruling
elders are to have no hand in church government.
Those ruling elders which are
in the votes of the Assembly, and in the
reformed churches, have neither the power
of civil magistracy (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua</span></span> elders, and many
of them not at all, being no magistrates),
nor yet are they the same, for office and

office, and, consequently, their ordination to
that office, is distinct from that of the minister
among all that I know. And so, excluding
all ruling elders from government who

5. Page 21, Where he makes reply to
what I said against his argument from
Eph. i. 19-21, he saith, He will blow
away all my discourse with this clear demonstration,
<span class="tei tei-q">“That which is given to
Christ he hath it not as God, and Christ
as God cannot be given. But this place
(Eph. i. 19-21) speaketh both of dignity
given to Christ, and of Christ as a gift
given; therefore Christ cannot be here
understood as God.”</span> This is in opposition
to what I said, p. 45, concerning the
headship and dignity of Christ, as the
natural son of God, <span class="tei tei-q">“the image of the
invisible God,”</span> Col. i. 15; and, p. 43, of
the dominion of Christ, as he is the <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal
Son of God.”</span> This being premised,
the brother's demonstration is so strong as
to blow himself into a blasphemous heresy.
I will take the proposition from himself,
and the assumption from Scripture, thus:
That which is given to Christ he hath it
not as God. But all power in heaven and
in earth is given to Christ, Matt. xxviii.
18; life is given to Christ, John v. 26;
authority to execute judgment is given to
Christ, ver. 27; all things are given into
Christ's hands, John iii. 35; the Father
hath given him power over all flesh, John
xvii. 2; He hath given him glory, John
xvii. 22: therefore, by Mr Coleman's principles,
Christ hath neither life, nor glory,
nor authority to execute judgment, nor
power over all flesh, as he is the eternal
Son of God, consubstantial with the Father,
but only as he is Mediator, God and man.
As for the giving of Christ as God, what if
I argue thus? If Christ, as he is the eternal
Son of God, or Second Person of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-011">[pg 3-011]</span><a name="Pg3-011" id="Pg3-011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ever-blessed Trinity, could not be given,
then the incarnation itself, or the sending
of the Son of God to take on our flesh,
cannot be called a giving of a gift to us.
But this were impious to say; therefore,
again, if Christ, as he is the Second Person
of the blessed Trinity, could not be
given, then the Holy Ghost, as the Third
Person, cannot be given (for they are
co-essential; and that which were a dishonour
to God the Son were a dishonour to God
the Holy Ghost); but to say that the
Holy Ghost cannot be given as the Third
Person, were to say that he cannot be given
as the Holy Ghost. And what will he then
say to all those scriptures that speak of
the giving of the Holy Ghost, Acts xv. 8;
Rom. v. 5; 1 John iv. 13, &amp;c.?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, As Mr Coleman's demonstration
hath blown away itself, so it could not
hurt me were it solid and good (as it is
not); for he should have taken notice, that,
in my examination, I did not restrict the
dignity given to Christ, Eph. i. 21, nor
the giving of Christ, ver. 22, to the Divine
nature only. Nay, I told, p. 44, 46, that
these words of the Apostle hold true even
of the human nature of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Page 21, He concludeth with a syllogism,
which he calleth the scope of my discourse
(I know not by what logic, the proposition
being forged by himself, and contrary
to my discourse); thus it is:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whosoever do not manage their office
and authority under Christ, and for Christ,
they manage it under the devil, and for the
devil; for there is no middle—either Christ
or Belial: he that is not with me is against
me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, according to the opinion of the
Commissioner, Christian magistracy doth
not manage the office and authority thereof
under Christ, and for Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore,—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He believes I shall be hard put to it to
give the kingdom a clear and satisfactory
answer. It is well that this is the hardest
task he could set me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The truth is, his syllogism hath <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quatuor
terminos</span></span>, and is therefore worthy to be exploded
by all that know the laws of disputation.
Those words in the proposition,
<span class="tei tei-q">“under Christ, and for Christ,”</span> can have
no other sense but to be serviceable to
Christ, to take part with him, and to be
for the glory of Christ, as is clear by the
confirmation added, <span class="tei tei-q">“He that is not with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-012">[pg 3-012]</span><a name="Pg3-012" id="Pg3-012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
me is against me.”</span> But the same words
in the assumption must needs have another
sense, <span class="tei tei-q">“Under Christ, and for Christ;”</span>
that is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice Christi</span></span>, in Christ's stead.
For that which I denied was, That magistracy
is derived from Christ as Mediator,
or that Christ as Mediator hath given a
commission of vicegerentship and deputyship
to the Christian magistrate to manage
his office and authority under, and for him,
and in his name; as is clear in my examination,
p. 42. Nay, Mr Coleman himself,
a little before his syllogism, p. 19, takes
notice of so much. His words are these:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Commissioner saith, Magistracy is
not derived from Christ: I say, Magistracy
is given to Christ to be serviceable
in his kingdom; so that, though the Commissioners
assertion be sound (which in
due place will be discussed), yet it infringeth
nothing that I said.”</span> Now then, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua
fide</span></span> could he, in his argument against me,
confound these two things which he himself
had but just now carefully distinguished?
If he will make anything of his syllogism
he must hold at one of these two
senses. In the first sense it is true that
all are either for Christ or against Christ;
and it is as true that his assumption must
be distinguished. For, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span>, the Christian
magistrate is for Christ when he doth
his duty faithfully, and is against Christ if
he be unfaithful. But, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de jure</span></span>, it holds
true universally, that the Christian magistrate
manageth his office under and for
Christ; that is, so as to be serviceable for
the kingdom and glory of Christ. In
the second sense (which only concerneth
me) taking <span class="tei tei-q">“under and for Christ,”</span> to be
in Christ's stead, as his deputies or
vicegerents, so his assumption is lame and imperfect,
because it doth not hold forth my opinion
clearly. That which I did, and still
do hold, is this: That the civil magistrate,
whether Christian or pagan, is God's vicegerent,
who, by virtue of his vicegerentship,
is to manage his office and authority under
God, and for God; that is, in God's stead,
and as God upon earth: but he is not the
vicegerent of Christ as Mediator, neither
is he, by virtue of any such vicegerentship,
to manage his office and authority under
Christ, and for Christ; that is, in Christ's
stead, and as Christ Mediator upon earth.
This was and is my plain opinion (not mine
alone, but of others more learned), and Mr
Coleman hath not said so much as yoυ to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-013">[pg 3-013]</span><a name="Pg3-013" id="Pg3-013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
confute it. So much for the assumption.
But in the same sense I utterly deny his
proposition, as being a great untruth in divinity;
for the sense of it can be no other
than this: Whosoever do not manage their
office and authority in Christ's stead, or as
deputies and vicegerents of Christ, as he is
Mediator, they manage it in the devil's
stead, as the devil's deputies and vicegerents.
Now I assume pagan magistrates do not manage
their office as the deputies and vicegerents
of Jesus Christ, as he is Mediator,
therefore as the devil's deputies. Which
way was the authority derived to them
from Christ as Mediator? Mr Coleman, p.
19, saith in answer to this particular, formerly
objected, that Christ is rightful king
of the whole earth, and all nations ought to
receive Christ, though as yet they do not.
But this helpeth him not. That which he
had to show was, that the pagan magistrate,
even while continuing pagan and not Christian,
doth manage his office as Christ's deputy
and vicegerent; if not, then I conclude
by his principles, a pagan magistrate is the
devil's deputy and vicegerent, which is contrary
to Paul's doctrine, who will have us
to be subject for conscience' sake, even to
heathen magistrates, as the ministers of
God for good, Rom. xiii. 1-7. By the
same argument Mr Coleman must grant
that generals, admirals, majors, sheriffs,
constables, captains, masters, yea, every
man that hath an office, is either Christ's
vicegerent, or the devil's vicegerent, than
which what can be more absurd? I might,
beside all these, show some other flaws in
his divinity, as, namely, p. 9 and 13, he
doth not agree to this proposition, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
admitting of the scandalous and profane to
the Lord's table, makes ministers to partake
of their sins;”</span> and he supposeth that ministers
may do their duty, though they admit
the scandalous; but of this elsewhere.

OF PARLIAMENT.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most honourable senators, I humbly beseech
you to look about you, and take notice
how far you are abused by Mr Coleman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. While he pretendeth to give you more
than his brethren, he taketh a great deal
more from you, and, so far as in him lieth,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-014">[pg 3-014]</span><a name="Pg3-014" id="Pg3-014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even shaketh the foundation of your authority.
The known tenure of magistracy is
from God. He is the minister of God (for
good, and the powers that are, are ordained
of God, saith the Apostle). The magistrate
is God's vicegerent; but now this brother
seeketh a new tenure and derivation of magistracy,
which takes away the old. He
told in his sermon, p. 27: <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ hath
placed governments in his church, 1 Cor.
xii. 28; of other governments besides magistracy
I find no institution, of them I do,
Rom. xiii. 1, 2. I find all government
given to Christ, and to Christ as Mediator
(I desire all to consider it), Eph. i. 21-23;
and Christ as head of those given to the
church.”</span> Here you have these three in
subordination, God, Christ, and the Christian
magistrate. God gives once all government,
even civil, to Christ, and to him as
Mediator. Well, but how comes it then to
the magistrate? Not straight by a deputation
from God. Mr Coleman's doctrine
makes an interception of the power. He
holds that God hath put it in Christ's hands
as Mediator. How then? The brother
holdeth that Christ, as Mediator, hath instituted
and placed the Christian magistrate,
yea, and no other government, in his church.
This was the ground of my answer, p. 42,
that he <span class="tei tei-q">“must either prove from Scripture,
that Christ, as Mediator, hath given such a
commission of vicegerentship and deputyship
to the Christian magistrate, or otherwise
acknowledge that he hath given a most
dangerous wound to magistracy, and made
it an empty title, claiming that power which
it hath no warrant to assume.”</span> I added:
<span class="tei tei-q">“As the Mediator hath not anywhere given
such a commission and power to the magistrate,
so, as Mediator, he had it not to give;
for he was not made a judge in civil affairs,
Luke xii. 14; <span class="tei tei-q">‘And his kingdom is not of
this world,’</span> John xviii. 36.”</span> Now, but what
reply hath he made to all this? Page 19,
he saith, Granting it all to be true and
sound, yet it infringeth not what he said.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The commissioner (saith he) saith magistracy
is not derived from Christ.”</span> I
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Magistracy is given to Christ to be
serviceable in his kingdom.”</span> But by his
good leave and favour, he said a great deal
more than this, for he spake of Christ's being
head of all civil governments, and his
placing these in his church as he is Mediator.
Yea, that fourth rule delivered by
him in his sermon, did hold forth these assertions:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-015">[pg 3-015]</span><a name="Pg3-015" id="Pg3-015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1. That God gave all government,
even civil, to Christ, and to him as Mediator;
2. That Christ, as Mediator, hath
power and authority to place, and substitute
under and for him, the Christian magistrate;
3. That Christ hath placed and instituted
civil governments in his church, to
be under and for him, as he is Mediator; 4.
That the Christian magistrate doth, and all
magistrates should, manage their office under
and for Christ (that is, as his vicegerents),
he being, as Mediator, head of all
civil government. Now instead of defending
his doctrine from my just exceptions
made against it, he resileth, and having
brought the magistrate in a snare, leaves
him there. He endeavours to vindicate no
more but this, That magistracy is given to
Christ to be serviceable in his kingdom.
But if he had said so at first, I had said
with him, and not against him, in that
point; and if he will yet hold at that, why
doth he, p. 19, refer my assertion to further
discussion?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, He hath abused the Parliament
in holding forth that rule to them in his
sermon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Establish as few things <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>
as can well be.”</span> And yet now he is
made, by strength of argument, to acknowledge,
p. 5, that this is a good rule, <span class="tei tei-q">“Establish
as many things <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span> as can
well be.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, I having stated the question to
be not whether this or that form of church
government be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>, but whether a
church government be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>; whether
Christ hath thus far revealed his will
in his word, that there are to be church
censures, and those to be dispensed by
church-officers. I said the brother is for
the negative of this question, p. 32. This
he flatly denieth, p. 5, 6, whereby he acknowledgeth
the affirmative, that there is a
church government <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>, and that
Jesus Christ hath so far revealed his will in
his word, that there are to be church censures,
and those to be dispensed by church-officers.
But how doth this agree with his
sermon? <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ hath placed governments
in his church. Of other governments (said
he) beside magistracy I find no institution,
of them I do.”</span> Is magistracy church government?
Are magistrates church officers?
Are the civil punishments church
censures? Is this the mystery? Yes,
that it is. He will tell us anon that the
Houses of Parliament are church officers;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-016">[pg 3-016]</span><a name="Pg3-016" id="Pg3-016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but if that bolt do any hurt I am much
mistaken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, He professeth to subscribe to
the votes of Parliament concerning church
government, p. 11; and yet he still pleadeth
that all ecclesiastical government is
merely doctrinal, p. 11, the Parliament having
voted that power to church-officers
which is not doctrinal (as I showed before).
And he adviseth the Parliament to keep
wholly in their own hands the corrective
part of church government, p. 14, though
the Parliament hath put into the hands of
elderships a power of suspension from the
sacrament, which is corrective.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fifthly, He did deliver, in that sermon
before the honourable House of Commons,
divers particulars, which being justly excepted
against, and he undertaking a vindication,
yet he hath receded from them, or
not been able to defend them, as that concerning
two co-ordinate governments in one
kingdom; and his argument concerning the
fear of an ambitious ensnarement in ministers,
these being by me infringed, he hath
not so much as offered to make them good.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sixthly, Having acknowledged, under his
own hand, that he was sorry he had given
offence to the reverend Assembly, and to
the Commissioners from Scotland, he now
appealeth to the Parliament, and tells us
they are able to judge of a scandalous sermon,
and they thought not so of it, p. 3. I
know they are able to judge of a scandalous
sermon: that they thought not so of it, it is
more than I know or believe. However I
know they have a tender respect to the offence
of others, even when themselves are
not offended, and so they, and all men,
ought to do according to the rule of Christ.
For his part, after he had acknowledged he
had given offence, it is a disservice to the
Parliament to lay over the thing upon
them. For my part, I think I do better service
to the Parliament in interpreting otherwise
that second order of the House, not
only desiring, but enjoining Mr Coleman to
print that sermon,—as near as he could,—as
he preached it. This was not, as he takes
it, one portion of approbation above all its
brethren (for I shall not believe that so wise
an auditory was not at all scandalised at the
hearing of that which was contrary both to
the covenant and to their own votes concerning
church government, nor at that
which he told them out of the Jewish records,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Hezekiah was the first man
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-017">[pg 3-017]</span><a name="Pg3-017" id="Pg3-017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that was ever sick in the world, and did recover”</span>);
but, as I humbly conceive it was a
real censure put upon him, his sermon being
so much excepted against and stumbled
at, the honourable House of Commons did
wisely enjoin him to print his sermon, that
it might abide trial in the light of the
world, and lie open to any just exceptions
which could be made against it abroad, and
that he might stand or fall to himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seventhly, He abuseth the Parliament
by arrogating so much to himself, as that
his sermon <span class="tei tei-q">“will, in the end, take away
all difference, and settle union,”</span> p. 3; and
that his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Model</span></span> will be, when he is dead,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the model of England's church government,”</span>
as he saith in his postscript. Whether
this be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophesying</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presuming</span></em> I
hope we are free to judge. And what if
the wisdom and authority of the honourable
Houses, upon advice from the reverend
and learned Assembly, choose another way
than this? Must all the synodical debates,
and all the grave parliamentary consultations,
resolve themselves into Mr Coleman's
way, like Jordan into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mare Mortuum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eighthly, He doth extremely wound the
authority of Parliament in making their
office to be a church office, and of the same
kind with the minister's office. P. 14, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do
not I hold ministers church officers?”</span> And
a little after, <span class="tei tei-q">“I desire the Parliament to
consider another presbyterian principle that
excludes your honourable Assembly from
being church officers.”</span> If so, then the
offices of the magistrate and of the minister
must stand and fall together; that is,
if the nation were not Christian the office
of magistracy should cease as well as that of
the ministry. And if he make the magistrate
a church officer, he must also give
him ordination, except, with the Socinians,
he deny the necessity of ordination.

have exercised my ministry there have been
some hundreds kept off; partly for ignorance,
and partly for scandal. The order
of the church of Scotland, and the acts of
General Assemblies, are for keeping off all
scandalous persons; which every godly and
faithful minister doth conscientiously and
effectually endeavour. And if, here or
there, it be too much neglected by some
Archippus, who takes not heed to fulfil the
ministry which he hath received of the
Lord, let him and his eldership bear the
blame, and answer for it.

Page 4, I having professed my unwillingness
to fall upon such a controversy in
a Fast sermon, he replieth, <span class="tei tei-q">“How can you
say you were unwilling?”</span> But how can you,
in brotherly charity, doubt of it after I had
seriously professed it? My doing it at two
several Fasts (the only opportunities I then
had to give a testimony to that presently
controverted truth) is no argument of the
contrary. May not a man do a thing

A fourth calumny is this: He had first
blamed two parties that they came biassed
to the Assembly; I answered, How then
shall he make himself blameless who came
biassed a third way; which was the Erastian
way; and that, for our part, we came
no more biassed to this Assembly than the
foreign divines came to the Synod of Dort,
Alexander to the Council of Nice, Cyril
to that of Ephesus, and Paul to the
synod at Jerusalem. But now, p. 6, 7,
instead of doing us right he doth us greater
injury; for now he makes us biassed, not
only by our own judgments, but by something
adventitious from without; which
he denieth himself to be (but how truly I
take not on me to judge: beholders do often
perceive the biassing better than the
bowlers); yea, he saith that I have acknowledged
the bias, and justify it. Where,
Sir? where? I deny it. It is no bias for
a man to be settled, resolved and engaged
in his judgment for the truth, especially
when willing to receive more light, and to
learn what needeth to be further reformed.
Hath he forgotten his own definition
of the bias which he had but just now
given? But he will needs make it more
than probable, by the instances which I
brought, that the Commissioners from
Scotland came not to this Assembly as divines,
by dispute and disquisition, to find
out truth, but as judges, to censure all different
opinions as errors; for so came foreign
divines to Dort, Alexander to the
Council of Nice, Cyril to Ephesus. Is it
not enough that he slander us, though he
do not, for our sakes, slander those worthy
divines that came to the Synod of Dort,
Alexander also, and Cyril, prime witnesses
for the truth in their days? Could no less
content him than to approve the objections
of the Arminians against the Synod of
Dort, which I had mentioned, p. 33? But
he gets not away so. The strongest instance
which I had given he hath not once
touched: it was concerning Paul and Barnabas,
who were engaged (not in the behalf
of one nation, but of all the churches of
the Gentiles) against the imposition of the
Mosaical rites, and had so declared themselves
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-021">[pg 3-021]</span><a name="Pg3-021" id="Pg3-021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at Antioch, before they came to Jerusalem.
Finally, Whereas he doubts,
though not of our willingness to learn
more, yet of our permission to receive
more: That very paper, first given in by
us (which I had cited, and unto which he
makes this reply), did speak not only of our
learning, but of the church of Scotland's
receiving, and, which is more, there is an
actual experiment of it, the last General
Assembly having ordered the laying aside of
some particular customs in that church, and
that for the nearer uniformity with this church
of England, as was expressed in their own
letter to the reverend Assembly of Divines.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A fifth calumny there is, p. 9, 6. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Commissioner is content that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span>

I was never content it should be a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">noli me
tangere</span></span> to the Parliament, but at most a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non necesse est tangere</span></span>, for so I explained
myself, p. 32, 33. If the Parliament establish

word of God, though they do not establish
it as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>, I acquiesce; in the meantime,
both they and all Christians, but especially
ministers, ought to search the Scriptures,
that what they do in matters of
church government, they may do it in faith
and assurance, that it is acceptable to God.
It was not of parliamentary sanction, but of
divines doctrinal asserting of the will of
God that I said, Why should <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span>

6. It seems strange to him that I did at
all give instance of the usefulness of church
government in the preservation of purity in
the ordinances and in church-members.
He saith, For an Independent to have
given this instance had been something;
but it seems strange to him that <span class="tei tei-q">“I should
have given an instance of the power and efficacy
of government, as it is presbyterial,
and contradistinct to congregational.”</span> This
is a calumny against presbyterial government,
which is neither privative nor contradistinct,
but cumulative to congregational
government; and the congregational is a
part of that government which is comprehended
under the name of presbyterial.
But in cases of common concernment, difficulty,
appeals, and the like, the preserving
of the ordinances and church-members from
pollution, doth belong to presbyteries and
synods.

thus far, that without it, ministers
<span class="tei tei-q">“shall not keep themselves nor the ordinances

church government hath power to purify
men, I never thought it, nor said it. That
which I said of the power (which he pointeth
at) was, that his way can neither preserve
the purity, nor advance the power of
religion, p. 40, and the reason is, because
his way provideth no ecclesiastical effectual
remedy for removing and purging away the
most gross scandalous sins, which are destructive
to the power of godliness. God
must, by his word and Spirit, purify men,
and work in them the power of godliness.
The church government which I plead for
against him, is a means subservient and
helpful, so far as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">removere prohibens</span></span>, to remove
that which apparently is impeditive

8. Having told us of the proud swelling
waves of presbyterial government, I asked
upon what coast had those waves done any

you bold then to slander it, when you can
give no sure ground for that you say? He

It had been an encroachment
indeed, if it had been so. But he

language (which I use not), p. 3 and 5:
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is, at the best, a most uncharitable slander,”</span>

There is no banishment in Scotland but
by the civil magistrate, who so far aideth

coming at a time into one of our presbyteries,
and hearing of somewhat which was
represented to or reported from the magistrate,
ought to have had so much, both circumspection
and charity, as not to make
such a rash and untrue report. He might
have at least inquired when he was in Scotland,
and informed himself better, whether
presbyteries or the civil magistrate do banish.
If he made no such inquiry, he was
rash in judging; if he did, his offence is
greater, when, after information, he will not
understand.

9. He makes this to be a position of
mine, p. 13, That <span class="tei tei-q">“a learned ministry puts
no black mark upon profaneness more than
upon others.”</span> A calumny. For, first, He
makes me to speak nonsense; Secondly, I
did not speak it of a learned ministry, but
of <span class="tei tei-q">“his way,”</span> p. 40. How long ago since
a learned ministry was known by the name
of Mr Coleman's way! His way is a ministry
without power of government or
church censures. Of this his way I said,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“it putteth no black mark upon profaneness
and scandal in church members
more than in any other;”</span> and the reason is,
because the corrective or punitive part of
government he will have to be only civil or
temporal, which striketh against those that
are without, as well as those within. But
the Apostle tells us of such a corrective government
as is a judging of those that are
within, and of those only, 1 Cor. v. 12;
and this way (which is not only ours, but
the apostolical way) puts a black mark upon
profaneness and scandalous sins in church
members more than in any others.

10. He saith of me, p. 17, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Commissioner

the intentions.”</span> A calumny. I judged nothing
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex ore tuo</span></span>; but in this thing he
himself hath trespassed. I will instance but
in two particulars: In that very place he
saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Admonition is a spiritual censure
in the Commissioner's opinion.”</span> Whence
knows he that to be my opinion? Consistorial
or presbyterial admonition given to the
unruly may be called a censure; and if this
were his meaning, then, ascribing to elderships
power of admonition, he gives them
some power of spiritual censures, and so
something of the corrective part of government,
which were contrary to his own principles.
But he speaketh it of the ministers'
admonishing, who are but a part of the elderships,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-024">[pg 3-024]</span><a name="Pg3-024" id="Pg3-024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as himself there granteth. Now,
where did I ever say or write, that admonition,
by a minister, is a spiritual censure?
Again, p. 4, he so judgeth me, that he not
only forsaketh, but contradicteth my words,
<span class="tei tei-q">“How can you say you were unwilling?”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. He saith, p. 16, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now the Commissioner

I said it? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dic sodes.</span></span> I never preached
before them but I exhorted them to meddle
with religion, and that in the first place,

prove that Mr Coleman will not have the
Parliament of England to meddle with civil
affairs, because he makes them church officers.
It is a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non sequitur</span></span>. Their power
is civil, therefore they are not to meddle
with religion. It will be a better consequence:
They are church officers: so he
makes them, p. 14; and <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian magistracy
is an ecclesiastical administration,”</span>
so he saith, p. 20, therefore they are not to
meddle with civil government.

SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr Coleman, p. 13, acknowledgeth, that
to assert anything contrary to the solemn
league and covenant, is a great fault in any,
in himself more than in divers others, if
made out; he having, for his own part,
taken it with the first, and not only so, but
having administered it to divers others.
Yes; and take this one circumstance more:
In his sermon upon Jer. xxx. 21, at the
taking of the covenant, Sept. 29, 1643, he
answereth this objection against the extirpation
of Prelacy: <span class="tei tei-q">“But what if the exorbitances
be purged away, may not I, notwithstanding
my oath, admit of a regulated Prelacy?”</span>
For satisfaction to this objection he
answereth thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“First, We swear not
against a government that is not; Secondly,
We swear against the evils of every government,
and doubtless many materials of Prelacy
must of necessity be retained as absolutely
necessary; Thirdly, Taking away
the exorbitances, the remaining will be a
new government and no Prelacy.”</span> Let
the brother now deal ingenuously. What
did he understand by those materials of
Prelacy absolutely necessary to be retained?
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-025">[pg 3-025]</span><a name="Pg3-025" id="Pg3-025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Did he understand the dispensing of the
word and sacraments, which is common to
all pastors? Or did he understand the privileges
of Parliament? Were either of
those two materials of Prelacy? And if
he had meant either of these, was this the
way to satisfy that scruple concerning the
extirpation of Prelacy? Again, What was
that new government which he promised
them after the taking away of the exorbitances
of the old? Was it the minister's
doctrinal part? That is no new thing in
England. Was it the Parliament's assuming
of the corrective part of church government,
as he improperly distinguisheth,
wholly and solely into their own hands, excluding
the ministry from having any hand
therein? This were a new government, I
confess. But, sure, he could not, in any reason,
intend this as a satisfaction to the scruples
of such as desired a regulated Prelacy,
whose scruples he then spoke to, for this
had been the way to dissuade them from,
not to persuade them to, the covenant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I go along with his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>.
P. 14, He explaineth himself and me thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“He should have said that I advised the
Parliament to lay no burden of government
upon them whom he, this Commissioner,
thinks church officers, then had he spoken
true.”</span> I thank him for his explanation.
And, I pray, who were the church officers
whom I said he excluded from church government?
Were they not pastors and
ruling elders? And doth not himself think
these to be church officers? Yes; of the
ministers he thinks so, but of ruling elders
he seems to doubt, except they be magistrates.
Well, but excluding those church
officers from church government he takes
with the charge. Why seeks he a knot in
the rush? But now how doth he explain
himself? He will have the Parliament to
be church officers (of which before), and
such church officers as shall take the corrective
part of church government wholly
into their own hands; yet not to dispense
the word and sacraments, but to leave the
doctrinal part to the ministry, and their
power to be merely doctrinal, as he saith,
p. 11. Thus you have his explanation.
But doth this solve the violating of the
covenant? Nay, it makes it more apparent;
for the government of the church,
which the first article of the covenant
speaks of, is distinguished from the doctrinal
part: <span class="tei tei-q">“That we shall endeavour the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-026">[pg 3-026]</span><a name="Pg3-026" id="Pg3-026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reformation of religion in the kingdoms of
England and Ireland, in doctrine, worship,
discipline and government.”</span> So that, excluding
pastors and ruling elders from the
corrective part of government, and from all
power which is not merely doctrinal, he
thereby excludeth them from that discipline
and government which the covenant speaks
of as one special part of the reformation of
religion. Come on to the reasons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had given four reasons; he takes notice
but of three. This is the second time he
hath told three for four, yet even these
three will do the business.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-q">“The extirpation of church government
is not the reformation of it.”</span> Here
the brother addeth these words following as
mine, which are not mine: <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore he
that finds no church government breaks his
covenant.”</span> His reply is, <span class="tei tei-q">“We must reform
it according to the word of God, if
that hold out none, here is no tailing.”</span> He
addeth a simile of a jury sworn to inquire
into the felony of an accused person, but
finds not guilty; and of three men taking
an oath to deliver in their opinions of
church government (where, by the way, he
lets fall that I hold the national synod to be
above all courts in the kingdom; which, if
he means of ecclesiastical courts, why did he
speak so generally? If he mean, above all
or any civil courts, it is a gross calumny.)
But now, if this be the sense which he gives
of that first article in the covenant, then, 1.
All that is in the second article might have
been put into the first article: for instance,
we might, in Mr Coleman's sense, have
sworn <span class="tei tei-q">“to endeavour the reformation of
Prelacy, and even of Popery itself, according
to the word of God, and the example of
the best reformed churches;”</span> that is, taking
an oath to deliver in our opinions of
these things according to the word of God,
and to inquire into the evils of church government
by archbishops, bishops, deans,
&amp;c., whether guilty or not guilty. I strengthened
my argument by the different nature
of the first and second article. I
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The second article is of things to be
extirpated, but this of things to be preserved
and reformed.”</span> Why did he not take the
strength of my argument and make a reply?
2. By the same principle of his we
are not tied by the first article of our covenant
to have any, either doctrine or worship,
but only to search the Scriptures whether
the word hold out any; for doctrine,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-027">[pg 3-027]</span><a name="Pg3-027" id="Pg3-027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worship, discipline and government, go hand
in hand in the covenant. 3. His own simile
hath this much in it against him. If
a jury, sworn to inquire into the felony of
an accused person, should, after such an
oath, not only find the person not guilty,
but further take upon them to maintain
that there is no such thing as felony, surely
this were inconsistent with their oath, so
he that swears to endeavour the reformation
of religion in doctrine, worship, discipline,
and government, and yet will not
only dislike this or that form of government,
but also hold that there is no such
thing as church government, he holds that
which cannot agree with his oath. 4. This
answer of Mr Coleman, leaving it free to
debate whether there be such as church
government, being his only answer to my
first argument from the covenant, must
needs suppose that the government mentioned
in the covenant, the reformation
whereof we have sworn to endeavour, is understood
even by himself of church officers'
power of corrective government, it being
the corrective part only, and not the
doctrinal part, which he casts upon an uncertainty
whether the world hold out any
such thing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-q">“Church government as mentioned in
the covenant is a spiritual, not a civil thing.
The matters of religion are put together,—doctrine,
worship, discipline and government.
The privileges of Parliament come
after in the third article.”</span> The reverend
brother replies, <span class="tei tei-q">“What if it be? therefore
the Parliament is not to meddle with it,
and why?”</span> And here he runs out against
me, as if I held that the Parliament is not
to meddle with religion, an assertion which
I abominate. Princes and magistrates' putting
off themselves all care of the matters of
religion, was one of the great causes of the
church's mischief, and of popish and prelatical
tyranny. But is this just and fair,
Sir, to give out for my opinion that for
which you are not able to show the least
colour or shadow of consequence from any
thing that ever I said? That which was to
be replied unto was, Whether do not the
materials of the first article of the covenant
differ from the materials of the third article
of the covenant? or whether are they the
same? Whether doth the privilege of
Parliament belong to the first article of the
covenant? Whether is that government
mentioned in the first article a civil thing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-028">[pg 3-028]</span><a name="Pg3-028" id="Pg3-028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or a spiritual? If civil, why is discipline
and government ranked with doctrine and
worship, and all these mentioned as parts
of the reformation of religion? If spiritual,
then why doth the brother make it <span class="tei tei-q">“civil
or temporal?”</span> p. 11. To all this nothing
is answered, but, <span class="tei tei-q">“What if it be?”</span> Then
is my argument granted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And to put it yet further out of question,
I add other two arguments from that same
first article of the covenant. One is this:
In the first part of that first article we swear
all of us to endeavour <span class="tei tei-q">“the preservation of
the reformed religion in the church of Scotland,
in doctrine, worship, discipline, and government,”</span>
where all know that the words
<span class="tei tei-q">“discipline”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“government”</span> (especially
being mentioned as two of the principal
things in which the reformed religion
in that church doth consist) signify church
government and church discipline distinct
both from doctrine and worship (which, by
the way, how Mr Coleman endeavoureth to
preserve, I will not now say, but leave it to
others to judge), therefore, in that which
immediately followeth,—our endeavouring
<span class="tei tei-q">“the reformation of religion in the kingdoms
of England and Ireland, in doctrine,
worship, discipline and government,”</span>—the
words <span class="tei tei-q">“discipline”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“government”</span> must
needs have the same sense thus far, that it
is a church discipline and a church government
distinct from the civil power of the
magistrate, and distinct also from doctrine
and worship in the church; for we cannot
make these words, <span class="tei tei-q">“discipline”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“government,”</span>
in one and the same article of
a solemn oath and covenant, to suffer two
senses differing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span> (especially considering
that the civil government is put by
itself in another article, which is the third),
unless we make it to speak so as none may
understand it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other argument which I now add is
this. In the third part of that first article
we swear that we <span class="tei tei-q">“shall endeavour to bring
the churches of God in the three kingdoms
to the nearest conjunction and uniformity
in religion, confession of faith, form of church
government, directory for worship and catechising,”</span>
where, 1. Church government doth
agree generically with a confession of faith,
directory of worship, and catechising. I
mean all these are matters of religion, none
of them civil matters. 2. It is supposed
there is such a thing as church government
distinct from civil government, and therefore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-029">[pg 3-029]</span><a name="Pg3-029" id="Pg3-029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is put out of all question, that so far
there shall be an uniformity between the
churches of God in the three kingdoms
(and otherwise it were an unswearing of
what was sworn in the first part of that
article), but it tieth us to endeavour the
nearest conjunction and uniformity <span class="tei tei-q">“in a
form of church government;”</span> which were a
vain and rash oath, if we were not tied to a
church government in general, and that as
a matter of religion. 3. The uniformity in
a form of church government which we swear
to endeavour must needs be meant of corrective
government; it being clearly distinguished
from the confession of faith and
directory of worship. So that Mr Coleman's
distinction of the doctrinal part, and
of the dispensing of the word and sacraments,
cannot here help him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From these two arguments (beside all
was said before) I conclude that the covenant
doth undeniably suppose, and plainly
hold forth this thing as most necessary and
uncontrovertible, that there ought to be a
church government which is both distinct
from the civil government, and yet not
merely doctrinal. And if so, what Apollo
can reconcile Mr Coleman's doctrine with
the covenant? And now I go on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My last reason formerly brought was this:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will the brother say that the example
of the best reformed churches leadeth his
way?”</span> For the covenant tieth us to a reformation
of the government of the church
both according to the word of God and the
example of the best reformed churches:
that as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regula regulans</span></span>; this as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regula
regulata</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reverend brother replieth: 1. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
best reformed church that ever was went
this way; I mean the church of Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. Is the church of Israel one of
the reformed churches which the covenant
speaks of? 2. Was the church of Israel better
reformed than the apostolical churches?
Why then calls he it the best reformed
church that ever was? 3. That in the Jewish
church there was a church government
distinct from civil government, and church
censures distinct from civil punishments, is
the opinion of many who have taken great
pains in the searching of the Jewish antiquities;
and it may be he shall hear it ere
long further proved, both from Scripture
and from the very Talmudical writers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-q">“I desire (saith he) the Commissioner
to give an instance in the New Testament
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-030">[pg 3-030]</span><a name="Pg3-030" id="Pg3-030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of such a distinction (civil and church government)
where the state was Christian.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> I desire him to give an instance in
the New Testament of these three things,
and then he will answer himself. 1. Where
was the state Christian? 2. Where had the
ministry a doctrinal power in a Christian
state? 3. Where doth the New Testament
hold out that a church government distinct
from civil government may be where the
state is not Christian, and yet may not be
where the state is Christian? Shall the
church's liberties be diminished, or rather
increased, where the state is Christian?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the third and fourth place, the brother
tells us of the opinions of Gualther,
Bulhager, Erastus, Aretius. The question
is of the examples of churches, not of the
opinions of men. But what of the men?
As for that pestilence that walketh in darkness
through London and Westminster, Liastus'
book against Beza, let him make of
it what he can, it shall have an antidote by
and by. In the meanwhile, he may take
notice, that, in the close of the sixth book,
Erastus casts down that which he hath
built, just as Bellarmine did, in the close of
his five books of justification. But as for
the other three named by the brother, they
are ours, not his, in this present controversy.
Gualther<a id="noteref_1340" name="noteref_1340" href="#note_1340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1340</span></span></a> expounds 1 Cor. v. all along of
excommunication, and of the necessity of
church discipline; insomuch that he expounds
the very delivering to Satan (the
phrase most controverted by Erastus and
his followers) of excommunication, and the
not eating with the scandalous (ver 9-11)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-031">[pg 3-031]</span><a name="Pg3-031" id="Pg3-031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he takes also to import excommunication.
He thinks also that ministers shall labour
to little purpose except they have a power
of government. Bullinger is most plain for
excommunication, as a spiritual censure ordained
by Christ, and so he understands
Matt. xviv. 17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Aretius holds<a id="noteref_1341" name="noteref_1341" href="#note_1341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1341</span></span></a> that God was the author
of excommunication in the Old Testament,
and Christ in the New. And now are these
three Mr Coleman's way? Or doth not his
doctrine flatly contradict theirs? Peradventure
he will say, Yet there is no excommunication
in the church of Zurich, where
those divines lived, nor any suspension of
scandalous sinners from the sacrament. I
answer, This cannot infringe what I hold,
that the example of the best reformed
churches maketh for us and against him;
for, 1. The book written by Lavater, another
of the Zurich divines, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Ritibus et Institutis
Ecclesioe Tigurinoe</span></span>, tells us of divers
things in that church which will make the
brother easily to acknowledge that it is not
the best reformed church, such as festival
days, cap. 8, that upon the Lord's days, before
the third bell, it is published and made
known to the people, if there be any houses,
fields, or lands, to be sold, cap. 9. They have
no fasts indicted, cap. 9, nor psalms sung in
the church, cap. 10. Responsories in their
Litany at the sacrament, the deacon upon
the right hand saith one thing, the deacon
upon the left hand saith another thing, the
pastor a third thing, cap. 13. 2. Yet the
church of Zurich hath some corrective
church government besides that which is
civil or temporal, for the same book, cap.
23, tells us, that in their synods, any minister
who is found scandalous or profane in his
life, is censured with deposition from his
office, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ab oficio deponitur</span></span>. Then follows,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">finita censura, singuli decani, &amp;c.</span></span> Here
is a synodical censure, which I find also in
Wolphius,<a id="noteref_1342" name="noteref_1342" href="#note_1342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1342</span></span></a> a professor of Zurich, and the
book before cited, cap. 24,<a id="noteref_1343" name="noteref_1343" href="#note_1343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1343</span></span></a> tells us of some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-032">[pg 3-032]</span><a name="Pg3-032" id="Pg3-032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
corrective power committed to pastors and
elders, which elders are distinguished from
the magistrates. 3. The Zurich divines themselves
looked upon excommunication as that
which was wanting through the injury of the
times; the thing having been so horribly
abused in Popery, and the present licentiousness
abounding among people, did hinder
the erecting of that part of the church discipline
at that time. But they still pleaded
the thing to be held forth in Scripture, and
were but expecting better times for restoring
and settling of excommunication, which
they did approve in Geneva, and in other
reformed churches, who had received it. I
give you their own words for the warrant of
what I say.<a id="noteref_1344" name="noteref_1344" href="#note_1344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1344</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have been the longer upon this point as
being the chief objection which can be made
by Mr Coleman concerning that clause in
the covenant, <span class="tei tei-q">“The example of the best reformed
churches.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He hath only one thing more, which may
well pass for a paradox. He will take an
instance, forsooth, from Geneva itself, though
presbyterian in practice. And why? Because
in the Geneva Annotations upon
Matt. ix. 16, it said, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the external discipline
is to be fitted to the capacity of the
church.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“This is no Scotland presbytery,”</span>
saith the brother. Nay, Sir, nor
yet Geneva presbytery; for it doth not at all
concern presbytery. It is spoken in reference
to the choosing of fit and convenient
times for fasting and humiliation,—that as
Christ did not, at that time, tie his disciples
to fasting, it being unsuitable to that present
time; so other like circumstances of God's
worship, which are not at all determined to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-033">[pg 3-033]</span><a name="Pg3-033" id="Pg3-033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the word, are to be accommodated to emergent
occasions, and to the church's condition
for the time, which both Scotland and
Geneva, and other reformed churches do.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If I have now more fully and convincingly
spoken to that point of the covenant,
let the brother blame himself that put me
to it.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3-034">[pg 3-034]</span><a name="Pg3-034" id="Pg3-034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Lord guide his people in a right
way, and rebuke the spirit of error and division,
and give us all more of his Spirit, to
lead us into all truth, and into all self-denial,
and grant that none of his servants be
found unwilling to have the Lord Jesus
Christ to reign over them in all his ordinances!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I did not begin this present controversy, so I
do not desire to hold up the ball of contention, yet
having appeared in it (neither alone, nor without a
calling and opportunity offered), I hold it my duty
to vindicate the truth of Christ, the solemn league
and covenant, the ordinances of Parliament, the
church of Scotland, and myself. For this end was
I born, and for this end came I into the world, that
I might bear witness to the truth, whereunto I am
so much the more encouraged, because it appeareth
already in this debate, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magna est vis veritatis</span></span>,—great
is the force of truth, and so great, that my
antagonists, though men of parts, and such as could
do much for the truth, yet, while they have gone
about to do somewhat against the truth, they have
mired themselves in foul errors; yea, so far is in
them lieth, have most dangerously shaken and endangered
the authority of magistrates, who are
God's vicegerents, and particularly the authority of
Parliament, and of parliamentary ordinances. They
have stumbled and fallen, and shall not be able to
rise but by the acknowledgment of the truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this following reply, I have not touched much
of the argumentative part in Mr Hussey's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plea for
Christian Magistracy</span></span>, reserving most of it to another
work, unto which this is a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prodromus</span></span> (howbeit
much of what he saith is the same with what I
did confute in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>, and his book,
coming forth a month after, takes no notice of that
second piece of mine, but speaketh only to the first).
Meanwhile, let him not believe that his big looking
title can, like Gorgon's head, blockify or stonify
rational men, so as they shall not perceive the want
or weakness of argument. It hath ever been a trick
of adversaries to calumniate the way of God and his
servants, as being against authority, but I will, by
God's assistance, make it appear to any intelligent
man, that the reverend brother hath pleaded very
much against magistracy, and so hath fallen himself
into the ditch which he hath digged for others, whilst
I withal escape.<a id="noteref_1345" name="noteref_1345" href="#note_1345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1345</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, now, what may be the meaning of Mr Coleman's
cabalistical title, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis Maledicis</span></span>?
Great philologists will tell him that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">maledico</span></span> is
taken in a good sense as well as in a bad, according
to the difference of matter and circumstances.
If any kind of malediction be justifiable, it is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">male
dicere maledicis</span></span>,—to speak evil to evil speakers, for
<span class="tei tei-q">“as he loved cursing, so let it come unto him as
he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from
him.”</span> But he doth worse, and his title, with a
transposition of letters, will more fitly reflect upon
himself <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">male dicis de amicus</span></span>. You, Sir, speak evil
of your friends, and of those that never wronged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-iii">[pg 4-iii]</span><a name="Pg4-iii" id="Pg4-iii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you. For my part, I have not shared with him in
evil speaking, nor rendered revilings for revilings.
I am sorry that he is so extremely ill of hearing,
as to take reason to be railing, and good sayings to
be evil sayings. He applieth to himself the Apostle's
words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Being reviled, we bless.”</span> But where
to find these blessings of his, those unwritten verities,
I know not. I am sure he had spoken more
truly if he had said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Being not reviled, we do revile.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the matter and substance of his reply, there
are divers particulars in it which serve rather to be
matter of mirth than of argument, as that a Parliament
parasite cannot be called an abuser of the Parliament,
and that passage, <span class="tei tei-q">“How can a clause delivered
in a postscript, concerning my opinion of
my way, be abusive to the Parliament?”</span> A great privilege
either of postscripts or of his opinions, that
they cannot be abusive to the Parliament. Many
passages are full of acrimony, many extravagant,
and not to the point in hand, many void of matter.
Concerning such Lactantius<a id="noteref_1346" name="noteref_1346" href="#note_1346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1346</span></span></a> gives me a good rule,
Otiosum est persequi singula,—it is an idle and unprofitable
thing to persecute every particular. And
much more I have in my eye the Apostle's rule,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let all things be done to edifying.”</span> 1 Cor. xiv. 26.
I have accordingly endeavoured to avoid such jangling,
and such debates as are unprofitable and unedifying,
making choice of such purposes as may
edify, and not abuse the reader.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Peradventure some will think I might have
wholly saved myself this labour. I confess I do
not look upon that which I make reply unto, as if it
were like to weigh much with knowing men, yet the
Apostle tells me that some men's mouths must be
stopped, and Jerome tells me<a id="noteref_1347" name="noteref_1347" href="#note_1347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1347</span></span></a> there is nothing
written without skill, which will not find a reader
with as little skill to judge, and some men grow too
wise in their own eyes when they pass unanswered.
Besides all this, a vindication and clearing of such
things as I mentioned in the beginning, may, by
God's blessing, anticipate future and further mistakes.
Read therefore and consider, and when thou
hast done, I trust thou shalt not think that I have
lost my labour. I pray the Lord that all our controversies
may end in a more cordial union for prosecuting
the ends expressed in the covenant and
especially the reformation of religion, according to
the word of God and the example of the best reformed
churches, and more particularly the practical
part of reformation, that the ordinances of
Jesus Christ may be kept from pollution, profaneness
and scandals shamed away, and piety commended
and magnified.

HIMSELF IN THE STATING OF THIS PRESENT
CONTROVERSY ABOUT CHURCH GOVERNMENT.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was before both denied and yielded by
Mr Coleman, that there is a church government
which is distinct from the civil,
and yet not merely doctrinal. He did profess
to subscribe heartily to the votes of
Parliament, and yet advised the Parliament
to do contrary to their votes, as I
proved in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>, p. 3. He answereth
now, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 4, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
deny an institution; I assent to prudence;
Where is the self-contradiction now?”</span> and,
p. 5, <span class="tei tei-q">“The advice looks to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span>;
the Parliament votes to prudence.”</span> Sir,
you have spoken evil for yourself; you have
made the self-contradiction worse. Will
you acknowledge your own words, in your
sermon, p. 25, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lay no more burden of
government upon the shoulders of ministers
than Christ hath plainly laid upon them;
have no more hand therein than the Holy
Ghost clearly gives them. The ministers
have other work to do, and such as will
take up the whole man,”</span> &amp;c.; <span class="tei tei-q">“I fear an
ambitious ensnarement,”</span> &amp;c.; and, in your
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>, p. 14, <span class="tei tei-q">“He should have
said, I advised the Parliament to lay no
burden of government upon them whom he
(this Commissioner) thinks church officers,
then had he spoken true.”</span> Now let the
reverend brother take heed to checkmate,
and that three several ways (but let him
not grow angry, as bad players use to do).
For, 1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eo ipso</span></span> that he denies the institution,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-002">[pg 4-002]</span><a name="Pg4-002" id="Pg4-002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by his principles he denies the prudence;
for he that denieth the institution,
and adviseth the Parliament to lay no more
burden of government upon ministers than
Christ hath plainly laid upon them, is against
the settling of the thing in a prudential
way, because it is not instituted.
But Mr Coleman denies the institution,
and adviseth the Parliament to lay no
more burden of government upon ministers
than Christ hath plainly laid upon them;
therefore Mr Coleman is against the settling
of the thing in a prudential way, because
it is not instituted. And how to reconcile
this with his denying of the institution
and yielding of the prudence, will require
a more reconciling head than Manasseh
Ben Israel Conciliator himself. 2. He
that adviseth the Parliament to lay no burden
of government upon ministers, because
they have other work to do which will take
up the whole man, and because of the fear
of an ambitious ensnarement, is against the
laying of any burden of corrective government
upon ministers, so much as in a prudential
way. But Mr Coleman adviseth
the Parliament, &amp;c.; therefore the consequence
in the proposition is necessary, unless
he will say that it is agreeable to the
rules of prudence to lay upon them more
work besides that which will take up the
whole man, or to commit that power unto
them which is like to prove an ambitious
ensnarement. 3. He that adviseth the
Parliament to lay no burden at all of corrective
government upon ministers and other
officers joined with them in elderships, but
to keep that power <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wholly</span></em> in their own
hands, is against the prudence of the thing,
as well as against the institution of it. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-003">[pg 4-003]</span><a name="Pg4-003" id="Pg4-003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mr Coleman adviseth the Parliament to
lay no burden at all of corrective government
upon these, but to keep that power
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wholly</span></em> in their own hands; therefore the
proposition is proved by that which himself
saith, The Parliament votes look to prudence.
So that the Parliament, having voted
a power of suspension from the sacrament
unto elderships, for so many scandals
as are enumerate in the ordinance (which
power is a part of that which he calls <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corrective</span></em>),
he that is against this power in
elderships is both against the prudence and
against the ordinance of Parliament. The
assumption I prove from his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>,
p. 14, where, after his denial of the
power to those whom we think church officers,
being charged with advising the Parliament
to take church government <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wholly</span></em>
into their own hands, his answer was, <span class="tei tei-q">“If
you mean the corrective power, I do so.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now, after all this, I must tell the
reverend brother that he might have saved
himself much labour had he, in his sermon
to the Parliament, declared himself (as now
he doth) that he was only against the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus
divinum</span></span>, but not against their settling of
the thing in a parliamentary and prudential
way. Did I not, in my very first examination
of his sermon, p. 32, remove this
stumbling block?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, withal, seeing he professeth to deny
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span> of a church government
differing from magistracy, why doth he
hold, p. 19, that the Independents are not
so much interested against his principles
as the Presbyterians? Did he imagine
that the Independents are not so much
for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span> of a church government
and church censures as the Presbyterians?
But, saith he, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Independents'
church power seems to me to be but
doctrinal.”</span> But is their excommunication
doctrinal? and do they not hold excommunication
to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>? Either he had
little skill in being persuaded, or some others
had great skill in persuading him that the
Independents' church power is but doctrinal,
and that they are not so much interested
against the Erastian principles as
the Presbyterians are; as if, forsooth, the
ordinance of excommunication (the thing
which the Erastian way mainly opposeth)
and a church government distinct from magistracy,
were not common to them both.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, If the reverend brother deny the
institution of church censures, but assent to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-004">[pg 4-004]</span><a name="Pg4-004" id="Pg4-004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the prudence, why doth he allege the Zurich
divines to be so much for him? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male
Dicis</span></span>, p. 23; for it was upon prudential
grounds, and because of the difficulty and
(as they conceived) impossibility of the
thing, that they were against it, still acknowledging
the scriptural warrants for
excommunication, as I shall show, yea,
have showed already; so that, if Mr Coleman
will follow them, he must rather say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I assent to an institution; I deny a prudence.”</span>

AND FLEEING FROM ARGUMENTS BROUGHT
AGAINST HIM, AND FROM MAKING GOOD
HIS OWN ASSERTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
CONCERNING THE DISTINCTION OF CIVIL
AND CHURCH GOVERNMENT.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reverend brother said in his sermon,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I could never yet see how two coordinate
governments, exempt from superiority
and inferiority, can be in one state.”</span>
To overthrow this general thesis, I brought
some instances to the contrary; such as
the governments of a general and an admiral,
of a master and a father, of a captain
and a master in a ship. He being
thus put to his vindication, replieth, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Commissioner acknowledgeth he did not
apply them to the Assembly (I said the
General Assembly) and Parliament; yet
that was the controversy in hand,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male
Dicis</span></span>, p. 5. But, by his favour, that was not
the controversy; for he was not speaking
particularly against the distinction of the
government of the General Assembly and
of the government of the Parliament (neither
had he one syllable to that purpose),
but generally against the distinction of
church government and civil government,
and particularly against excommunication;
in all which he excluded presbyteries as
well as General Assemblies. Wherefore he
doth now recede not only from defending
his thesis, but from applying it against the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-005">[pg 4-005]</span><a name="Pg4-005" id="Pg4-005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
power of presbyteries. And so far we are
agreed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. I having confuted his argument grounded
on Psal. xxxiii. 15; Prov. xxvii. 19, he
shifteth the vindication of it, and still tells
me he grounded no argument on those
places, but spake <span class="tei tei-q">“by way of allusion,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 6. Now let the reader
judge. His words to the Parliament were
these: <span class="tei tei-q">“Might I measure others by myself,
and I know not why I may not (God
fashions men's hearts alike; and as in water
face answers face, so the heart of man
to man), I ingenuously profess I have a
heart that knows better how to be governed
than govern; I fear an ambitious ensnarement,”</span>
&amp;c. This argument, there
largely prosecuted, hath no other ground
but the parenthesis using the words (though
not quoting the places) of Scripture. And
now, forsooth, he hath served the Parliament
well, when, being put to make good
the sole confirmation of his argument, he
tells it was but an allusion. But this is not
all. I confuted the whole argument drawn
from his own heart to the hearts of others,
and gave several answers: but neither before,
nor now, hath he offered to make
good his argument.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The reverend brother cited 1 Cor. x.
33, to prove that all government is either a
heathenish government, or a Jewish government,
or a church government. This
I denied: <span class="tei tei-q">“Because the government of generals,
admirals, mayors, sheriffs, is neither
a Jewish government, nor a church government,
nor a heathenish government.”</span> What
saith he to this? <span class="tei tei-q">“I deny it; a Jewish
general is a Jewish government,”</span> &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male
Dicis</span></span>, p. 6. Deny it? No, Sir, you must
prove (because you are the affirmer) that a
Christian general, a Christian admiral, are
church governments. For I deny it. You
tell us, p. 7, you are persuaded it will trouble
the whole world to bound civil and ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, the one from the
other. You shall have them bounded and
distinguished ere long, and the world not
troubled neither. Meanwhile you have not
made out your assertion from 1 Cor. x. 33.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The reverend brother had cited Rom.
xiii. 4, to prove that the corrective part of
church government belongs to the Christian
magistrate. And now he brings in
my reply thus: that I said he abuseth the
place, <span class="tei tei-q">“Because spiritual censures belong
not to the civil magistrate;”</span> which, saith
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-006">[pg 4-006]</span><a name="Pg4-006" id="Pg4-006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he, begs the question, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 7. I
replied no such thing upon this argument.
Look at my words again. How can the brother
answer it,—to shape answers of his own
devising as if they were mine? My answer
was, That the punitive part, Rom.
xiii. 4, belongs to all magistrates, whether
Christian or infidel; which he takes notice
of in the second place, and bids me prove
<span class="tei tei-q">“that Scripture-commands belong to infidels;”</span>
not observing that the question is
not of Scripture-commands, but whether a
duty mentioned in this or that scripture
may not belong to infidels. There are two
sorts of duties in Scripture; some which
are duties by the law of God, written in
man's heart at his creation, some principles
and notions whereof remain in the hearts of
all nations, even infidels by nature; other
duties are such, by virtue of special commands
given to the church, which are not
contained in the law of nature. The first
sort (of which the punishing of evil doers,
mentioned Rom. xiii. 4, is one) belongs to
those that are without the church as well as
those within. The other only to those that
are within.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The reverend brother had said in his
sermon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Of other governments besides
magistracy I find no institution.”</span> I cited
1 Thess. v. 12; 1 Tim. v. 17; Heb. xiii.
7, 17, to prove another government (yea,
the institution of another government) besides
magistracy. And, in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>,
I told he had laughed, but had
not yet loosed the knot. Now hear his two
answers: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 8, <span class="tei tei-q">“First, for the
institution; for the Commissioner affirms so
much. Had he said that these texts hold
out an office or officer already instituted,
the words would have borne him out,”</span> &amp;c.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But the institution in this place I cannot
see.”</span> See the like in Mr Hussey, p. 19,
22. I thank them both. That Scripture
which supposeth an institution, and holds
out an office already instituted, shall to me
(and, I am confident, to others also) prove
an institution; for no text of Scripture can
suppose or hold out that which is not true.
Nay, hath Mr Coleman forgotten that himself
proved an institution of magistracy from
Rom. xiii. 1, 2? Yet that text doth but
hold out the office of magistracy already
instituted: but the institution itself is not
in that place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, Mr Coleman answereth to all
these three texts. To that, 1 Thess. v. 12,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-007">[pg 4-007]</span><a name="Pg4-007" id="Pg4-007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Them which are over you in the Lord,”</span>
he saith that these words prove not that it
is not meant of magistracy. But he takes
not the strength of the argument. My
words were, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here are some who are no
civil magistrates set over the Thessalonians
in the Lord.”</span> This the reverend brother
must admit to be a good proof, or otherwise
say that the civil magistrates set over
the Thessalonians, though they were heathens,
yet were set over them in the Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For that of 1 Tim. v. 17, he saith it doth
not hold out ruling elders. Whether it
doth hold ruling elders or not, doth not at
all belong to the present question. It is
easy to answer something, so that a man
will not tie himself to the point. The place
was brought by me to prove <span class="tei tei-q">“another government
beside magistracy,”</span> which he denied.
Now suppose the place to be meant
only of preaching elders, yet here is a rule
or government: <span class="tei tei-q">“Elders that rule well;”</span>
and these are no civil magistrates, but such
as <span class="tei tei-q">“labour in the word and doctrine.”</span>
Come on now. <span class="tei tei-q">“But I will deal clearly
(saith the brother): These officers are ministers
which are instituted not here, but
elsewhere,—and these are the rulers here
mentioned. And so have I loosed the
knot.”</span> Now, Sir, you shall see I will not
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">male dicere</span></span>, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bene dicere</span></span>. My blessing
on you for it. You have at last loosed
the knot so perfectly, that you are come to
an agreement with me in this great point,
which I thus demonstrate: He that acknowledgeth
ministers to be instituted rulers,
acknowledgeth another instituted government
beside magistracy. But Mr Coleman
acknowledgeth ministers to be instituted
rulers, therefore Mr Coleman acknowledgeth
another instituted government beside
magistracy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the other texts, Heb. xiii. 7, 17, he
saith nothing against my argument, only expounds
the rulers to be guides, as Mr Hussey
also doth, of which more elsewhere;
meanwhile it is certain that ὁ ἡγουμένοις is
usually taken for a name of highest authority,
yea, given to emperors; for which see
learned Salmasius in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Walo Messalinus</span></span>,
p. 219, 220. It is Joseph's highest title to
express his government of Egypt, Acts vii.
10. It must the rather be a name of government
and authority in this place, Heb.
xiii. 17, because subjection and obedience
is required: <span class="tei tei-q">“Obey them that have the
rule over you, and submit yourselves.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-008">[pg 4-008]</span><a name="Pg4-008" id="Pg4-008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
When the word signifieth ὀδηγὸν, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seu viæ
ducem</span></span> (and it is very rarely so used by
the Septuagints, but frequently, and almost
in innumerable places, they use it for a name
of rule and authority), obedience and subjection
is not due to such an one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua talis</span></span>;
for obedience and subjection cannot be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">correlata</span></span>
to the leading of the way, when it is
without authority and government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. I having charged Mr Coleman's doctrine
with this consequence, <span class="tei tei-q">“That there
ought to be neither suspension from the sacrament,
nor excommunication, nor ordination,
nor deposition of ministers, nor receiving
of appeals, except all these things be
done by the civil magistrate,”</span> which things,
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“are most of them corrective, and all
of them more than doctrinal,”</span>—instead of
making answer, the reverend brother expresseth
the error, which I objected to him,
thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“That here are no church censures,”</span> which
is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quæsitum</span></span>, saith he, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>,
p. 10. Here, again, he brings an imagination
of his own, both for matter and
words, instead of that which I said, and
doth not take the argument right. If the
minister's power be merely doctrinal, and
government wholly in the magistrate's
hands, then all the particulars enumerated;
for instance, suspension from the sacrament,
and the receiving of appeals (which
he must not bring under the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quæsitum</span></span>, except
he bring the ordinance of Parliament
under the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quæsitum</span></span>), shall be wholly in the
magistrate's hand; and elderships may not
suspend from the sacrament; classes and synods
may not receive appeals, which yet, by
the ordinance, they have power to do. One
of the particulars, and but one, the reverend
brother hath here touched, and it is
this: <span class="tei tei-q">“For ordination of ministers, I say,
it is within the commission of teaching, and
so appertains to the doctrinal part.”</span> This
is the effect of his zeal to maintain that all
ecclesiastical ministerial power is merely
doctrinal. But mark the consequence of it:
He that holds ordination of ministers to be
within the commission of teaching, and to
appertain to the doctrinal part, must hold,
by consequence, that the power of ordination
is given <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">uni</span></span> as well as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unitati</span></span>; that is,
that every single minister hath power to
ordain, as well as the classes. But Mr Coleman
holds ordination of ministers to be within
the commission of teaching, &amp;c. The
reason of the proposition is clear, because
the commission of teaching belongs to every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-009">[pg 4-009]</span><a name="Pg4-009" id="Pg4-009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
single minister, so that if the power of
ordination be within that commission, it
must needs belong to every single minister.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid respondes</span></span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The reverend brother having brought
an odious argument against me, which did
conclude the magistrate to manage his office
for and under the devil, if not for and under
Christ, I show his syllogism to have four
terms, and therefore worthy to be exploded.
I get now two replies:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is an error (if one) in logic,
not divinity. Is it an error in divinity to
make a syllogism with four terms?”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male
Dicis</span></span>, p. 15. See now if he be a fit man
to call others to school, who puts an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em> in
this business—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if one</span></em>. Who did ever doubt
of it? And if it be an error in divinity
to be fallacious, and to deceive, then it is
an error in divinity to make a syllogism
with four terms, yea, as foul an error as
can be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, He admitteth not my distinction
of those words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Under Christ, and for
Christ.”</span> I said the Christian magistrate is
under Christ, and for Christ, that is, he is
serviceable to Christ, but he is not under
Christ nor for Christ as Christ's vicegerent,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice Christi</span></span>, in Christ's stead, as Christ is
Mediator. The reverend brother saith, He
foresaw that this would be said (the greater
fault it was to make his argument so unclear
and undistinct), but he rejecteth the distinction
as being <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">distinctio sine differentia</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“If a magistrate (saith he) be thus far a
servant of Christ, as Mediator, that he is to
do his work, to take part with him, to be
for his glory, then he doth it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice Christi</span></span>.”</span>
He adds the simile of a servant. Hence it
follows, by the reverend brother's principles,
that the king's cook, because he doth work
and service for the king, therefore he doth
it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice regis</span></span>, and as the king's vicegerent.
Likewise, that a servant who obeyeth his
master's wife, and executeth her commands,
because it is his master's will, and for his
master's honour, doth therefore obey his
master's wife <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice domini</span></span>, as his master's
vicegerent; and, by consequence, that the
duty of obedience to the wife doth originally
belong to the husband; for the capacity of
a vicegerent, which he hath by his vicegerentship,
is primarily the capacity of him
whose vicegerent he is. These, and the like
absurd consequences, will unavoidably follow
upon the reverend brother's argumentation,
that he who doth Christ service doth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-010">[pg 4-010]</span><a name="Pg4-010" id="Pg4-010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice Christi</span></span>, as Christ's vicegerent; and
that to be a man's vicegerent, and to do a
man's work or service, which I made two
different things, are all one. But, further,
observe his tergiversation. I had, p. 13,
proved my distinction out of these words of
his own: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Commissioner saith, Magistracy
is not derived from Christ. I say,
magistracy is given to Christ to be serviceable
in his kingdom; so that, though the
Commissioner's assertion be sound (which in
due place will be discussed), yet it infringeth
nothing that I said.”</span> I asked, therefore,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua fide</span></span> he could confound in his argument
brought against me those two things
which himself had so carefully distinguished.
There is no reply to this in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>.
When the brother thought it for his advantage,
he denied that the magistrate's being
serviceable to Christ doth enter the derivation
of his power by a commission of vicegerentship
from Christ (for that was the derivation
spoken of), and yielded that the
magistrate may be said to be serviceable to
Christ, though his power be not derived
from Christ. Now he denieth the very
same distinction for substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Whereas the reverend brother had told
the Parliament that he seeth not, in the
whole Bible, any one act of that church government
which is now in controversy, I
brought some scriptural instances against
his opinion, not losing either the argument
from Matt. xviii. (concerning which he asketh
what is become of it), or other scriptural
arguments, which I intend, by God's assistance,
to prosecute elsewhere. Now hear
what is replied to the instances which were
given. First, To that, 1 Cor. v. 13, <span class="tei tei-q">“Put
away that wicked person from among you,”</span>
his answer is, <span class="tei tei-q">“I say, and it is sufficient
against the Commissioner, If this be a
church censure, then the whole church
jointly, and every particular person, hath
power of church censure.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>,
p. 10. I hope, Sir, it is not sufficient
against me that you say it, so long as you
say nothing to prove it. I told you that
Mr Prynne himself (who holds not that
every particular person hath power of church
censure) acknowledged that text to be a
warrant for excommunication, and when
you say <span class="tei tei-q">“every particular person,”</span> you say
more than the Independents say, and I am
sure more than the text will admit, for the
text saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Put away from among you,”</span>
therefore this power was given not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">uni</span></span>, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-011">[pg 4-011]</span><a name="Pg4-011" id="Pg4-011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unitati</span></span>, and this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unitas</span></span> was the presbytery
of Corinth. The sentence was inflicted ὑπὸ
τῶν πλείονων,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">by many</span></span>, 2 Cor. ii. 6, it is
not said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">by all</span></span>. I might say much for this,
but I will not now leave the argument in
hand; for it is enough against Mr Coleman
that the place prove an act of church government,
flowing from a power not civil
but ecclesiastical. To whom the power belonged
is another question.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the next instance, from 2 Cor. ii. 6,
which is coincident with the former, a punishment
or censure inflicted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by many</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“It
is only a reprehension (saith he),—ἐπιτιμία,—which,
by all the places in the New Testament,
can amount no higher than to an
objurgation, and so is doctrinal.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
He made it even now an act of the whole
church jointly, and of every particular person.
Why did he not clear himself in this,—how
the whole church, men, women, children
and all, did doctrinally reprehend him?
2. If the objurgation must be restricted, To
whom? Not to a single minister (yet every
single minister hath power of doctrinal objurgation),
but to the presbytery. It was an
act of those πλειόνες I spake of; and this is a
ground for that distinction between ministerial
and presbyterial admonition, which Mr
Coleman, p. 22, doth not admit. 3. If it
were granted that ἐπιτιμία in this text
amounteth to no more but an objurgation,
yet our argument stands good; for the
Apostle having, in his first epistle, required
the Corinthians to put away from among
them that wicked person, which they did
accordingly resolve to do (which makes the
Apostle commend their obedience, 2 Cor.
ii. 9), no doubt either the offender was at
this time actually excommunicated and cast
out of the church, or (as others think) they
were about to excommunicate him, if the
Apostle had not, by his second epistle, prevented
them, and taken them off with this
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sufficit</span></span>: Such a degree of censure is enough,
the party is penitent, go no higher. 4.
When the reverend brother appealeth to
all the places in the New Testament, he
may take notice that the word ἐπιτιμία is
nowhere found in the New Testament, except
in this very text. And if his meaning
be concerning the verb ἐπιτιράω he may
find it used to express a coercive power, as
in Christ's rebuking of the winds and waves,
Matt. viii. 26; Mark iv. 39; his rebuking
of the fever, Luke iv. 39; his rebuking of
the devil (which was not a doctrinal, but a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-012">[pg 4-012]</span><a name="Pg4-012" id="Pg4-012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
coercive rebuke), Mark i. 25; ix. 25; Luke
iv. 35; ix. 42. Sometimes it is put for an
authoritative charge, laying a restraint upon
a man, and binding him from liberty in this
or that particular, as Matt. xii. 16; Mark
iii. 12; viii. 30; Luke ix. 21. The word
ἐπιτιμία I find in the apocryphal book of
Wisdom, chap. iii. 10. It is said of the
wicked, ἓξουσιν ἐπιτιμίαν, they shall have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">correction</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">punishment</span></em>. The whole
chapter maketh an opposition between the
godly and the wicked, in reference to
punishments and judgments. The Hebrew
געד (which, if the observation hold which
is made by Arias Montanus, and divers
others, following Kimchi, when it is construed
with ב signifieth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">objurgavit</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">duriter
reprehendit</span></span>; when without ב, it signifieth
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">corrupit</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">perdidit</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">maledixit</span></span>), the
Septuagint do most usually turn it ἐπιτιμάω
and that in some places where it is
without ב, as Psal. cxix. 21, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast
rebuked the proud that are cursed;”</span> ἐπιτίμησας,—Pagnin,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">disperdidisti</span></span>,—thou hast
destroyed, so the sense is; it is rebuke,
with a judgment or a curse upon them.
The second part of the verse, in the Greek,
is exegetical to the first part, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast
rebuked the proud, ἐπικατάρατοι, cursed
are they,”</span> &amp;c.; so Zech. iii. 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord
rebuke (ἐπιτιμήσαι) thee, O Satan.”</span> The
same phrase is used in Jude, ver. 9, which
must needs be meant of a coercive, efficacious,
divine power, restraining Satan. The
same original word they render by ἀφορίζω,
which signifieth to separate and to excommunicate,
Mal. ii. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold I will corrupt
your seed,”</span> &amp;c. In the preceding
words, God told them that he would curse
them. The same word they render by ἀποσκορανίζω,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">extermino</span></span>, Isa. xvii. 13, a place
which speaks of a judgment to be inflicted,
not of a doctrinal reproof. Yet Aquila readeth
there ἐπιτιμήσει; likewise the word which
the Septuagint render ἀπώλεια, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">perdition</span></span>,
Prov. xiii. 6, and θυμὸς, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">wrath</span></span>, Isa. li. 20,
in other places they render it ἐπιτίμησις:
Psal. lxxvi. 6, <span class="tei tei-q">“At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
both the chariot and horse are cast into a
dead sleep;”</span> lxxx. 16, <span class="tei tei-q">“They perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance.”</span> These are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
rebukes, that is, judgments and punishments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. What saith Mr Coleman to Pasor,
who expounds ἐπιτιμία to be the same with
ἐπιτίμιον, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mulcta</span></span>, and that, 2 Cor. ii. 6.
it is meant of excommunication; which he
proves by this reason, Because, in the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-013">[pg 4-013]</span><a name="Pg4-013" id="Pg4-013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
place, the Apostle exhorteth the Corinthians
to forgive him. Add hereunto Erasmus's
observation upon the word κυρῶσαι<a id="noteref_1348" name="noteref_1348" href="#note_1348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1348</span></span></a>
(ver. 8, to <span class="tei tei-q">“confirm your love toward
him”</span>); that it implies an authoritative ratification
of a thing by judicial suffrage and
sentence. Which well agreeth to the πλειόνες,
ver. 6; that is, that they who had judicially
censured him, should also judicially
loose him and make him free. Now, therefore,
the circumstances and context being
observed, and the practice, 2 Cor. ii. 6,
compared with the precept, 1 Cor. v. 13,
I conclude, that, whether this ἐπιτιμία was
excommunication already inflicted, or whether
it was a lesser degree of censure, tending
to excommunication,—a censure it was,
and more than ministerial objurgation. And
it is rightly rendered by the English translators
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">punishment</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">censure;</span></span> which well
agreeth with the signification of the verb

denieth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the next instance, from 1 Tim. v. 19,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Against an elder receive not an accusation,
but before two or three witnesses,”</span> the
reverend brother answereth, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is either
in relation to the judgment of charity, or
ministerial conviction, as the verses following.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1. That of two or three witnesses
is taken from the law of Moses, where
it is referred only to a forensical proceeding.
But in relation either to the judgment
of charity, or ministerial conviction,
it is not necessary that there be two or
three witnesses. If a scandalous sin be
certainly known to a minister, though the
thing be not certified by two or three witnesses,
yet a minister, upon certain knowledge
had of the fact, may both believe
it and ministerially convince the offender.
But there may not be a consistorial proceeding
without two or three witnesses. 2.
Since he appealeth to the following verses,
let ver. 22 decide it: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lay hands suddenly
on no man.”</span> To whom the laying
on of hands or ordination did belong, to
them also it did belong to receive an accusation
against an elder: but to the presbytery
did belong the laying on of hands,
or ordination, 1 Tim. iv. 14; therefore to
the presbytery did belong the receiving of
an accusation against an elder. And so it
was not the act of a single minister, as
ministerial conviction is.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the last instance, from Rev. ii. 14,
15, 20, the reverend brother answers, That
he had striven to find out how church censures
might be there grounded, but was
constrained to let it alone. But what is it,
in his opinion, which is there blamed in the
angels of those churches? Doth he imagine
that those who are so much commended by
Christ himself for their holding fast of his
name, and of the true faith, did not so much
as doctrinally or ministerially oppose the
foul errors of the Balaamites and of Jezebel?
No doubt but this was done: but
Christ reproves them, because such scandalous
persons were yet suffered to be in
the church, and were not cast out. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
have a few things against thee, because thou
hast there them that hold the doctrine of
Balaam;”</span> and, ver. 20, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou sufferest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-015">[pg 4-015]</span><a name="Pg4-015" id="Pg4-015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that woman Jezebel.”</span> And why was the
very having or suffering them in the church
a fault, if it had not been a duty to cast
them out of the church? which casting out
could not be by banishment, but by excommunication.
It did not belong to the angel
to cast out the Balaamites out of Pergamos,
but he might, and ought to have cast
them out of the church in Pergamos.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Mr Coleman hath another passage
against the distinction of church censures
and civil punishments. <span class="tei tei-q">“But what are ecclesiastical
censures (saith he)? Let us take
a taste. Is deposition from the ministry?
This kings have done,”</span> &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p.
7. Now <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">similia labra lactucis</span></span>. But for
all that, the taste is vitiated, and doth not
put a difference between things that are
different. Deposition is sometimes taken,
improperly, for expulsion; as Balsamon, in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conc. Nicoen.</span></span>, can. 19, doth observe. And
so the Christian magistrate may remove or
put away ministers when they deserve to be
put away, that is, by a coercive power to
restrain them, imprison or banish them,
and, in case of capital crimes, punish them
with capital punishments. King James, having
once heard a dispute in St. Andrews
about the deposition of ministers, was convinced
that it doth not belong to the civil
magistrate, <span class="tei tei-q">“yet (said he) I can depose a
minister's head from his shoulders.”</span> Which
was better divinity than this of Mr Coleman.
If we take deposition properly, as
it is more than the expelling, sequestering
or removing of a minister from this or that
place, and comprehendeth that which the
Council of Ancyra, can. 18, calls Ἀφαιρεισθαι
την τιμὴι τον πρεσβυτεριον, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the honour
of presbytership to be taken away</span></span>, or a
privation of that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">presbyteratus</span></span>, the order
of a presbyter, and that ἐξουσία, the authority
and power of dispensing the word, sacraments,
and discipline, which was given in
ordination, so none have power to depose
who have not power to ordain. It belongeth
not to the magistrate either to make or
unmake ministers. Therefore, in the ancient
church, the bishops had power of the
deposition as well as of the ordination of
presbyters, yet they were bound up that
they might not depose either presbyter or
deacon without the concurrence of a presbytery
or synod in the business.<a id="noteref_1352" name="noteref_1352" href="#note_1352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1352</span></span></a> Mark,

of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">synod</span></em>, not of the magistrate. As
for the testimonies brought by Mr Coleman,
he doth, both here and in divers other
places, name his authors, without quoting
the places. It seems he hath either found
the words cited by others, but durst not
trust the quotations, or else hath found
somewhat in those places which might make
against him. However, all that he can cite
of that kind concerning deposition of ministers
by emperors, is meant of a coercive expulsion,
not of that which we call properly
deposition. And to this purpose let him
take the observation of a great antiquary.<a id="noteref_1353" name="noteref_1353" href="#note_1353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1353</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, withal, he may take notice that
Protestant writers<a id="noteref_1354" name="noteref_1354" href="#note_1354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1354</span></span></a> do disclaim the magistrate's
power of deposing ministers, and
hold that deposition is a part of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction: ministers being always
punishable (as other members of the commonwealth),
according to the law of the
land, for any offence committed against
law.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr Coleman's doctrine was by me charged
to be a violation of the solemn league
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-017">[pg 4-017]</span><a name="Pg4-017" id="Pg4-017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and covenant. This he acknowledged in
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>, p. 13, 17, to be a
very grievous charge, and a greater fault
in him than in divers others, if made out;
and he desired seriously, yea, challenged it
by the right of a Christian, and by the
right of a minister, that I should prosecute
this charge; whereupon I did, in my
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>, prosecute it so far, that,
by five strong arguments, I did demonstrate
the repugnancy of his doctrine to the
covenant. About a month afterward comes
out Mr Hussey's book, wherein the charge
itself (before desired to be prosecuted) is
declined expressly by Mr Coleman in the
few lines by him prefixed (which are ranked
together with the errata), in which he
desires that the argumentative part may be
so prosecuted as that the charge of covenant-breaking
may be laid aside; which, if
it be taken up, he lets me know beforehand
it shall be esteemed by them a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil respondes</span></span>.
It is also declined by Mr Hussey,
p. 15: <span class="tei tei-q">“The argument of the covenant
is too low to be thought on in the
discourse: we are now in an higher region
than the words of the covenant,”</span> &amp;c.:—a
tenet looked upon by the reformed churches
as proper to those that are inspired with
the ghost of Arminius;<a id="noteref_1355" name="noteref_1355" href="#note_1355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1355</span></span></a> for the remonstrants,
both at and after the Synod of
Dort, did cry down the obligation of all
national covenants, oaths, &amp;c., in matters
of religion, under the colour of taking the
Scripture only for a rule. Well, we see
the charge declined as nothing. But this
is not all. Almost two months after my
proof of the charge, Mr Coleman comes
out with his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, and declines both
the charge itself (which he calls an <span class="tei tei-q">“impertinent
charge,”</span> p. 22), and my five arguments
too, without so much as taking notice
of them, or offering replies to them;
yea, all that I said in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>,
p. 27-34, in prosecution of this argument
concerning covenant-breaking, the reverend
brother hath skipped over <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sicco pede</span></span> in
the half of one page, p. 23; all that follows
is new and other matter, wherein he
did not mind his own answer to the learned
viewer, p. 33, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will keep you to the
laws of disputation, and will not answer but
as it is to the matter in hand.”</span> I leave it
to be judged by men of knowledge and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-018">[pg 4-018]</span><a name="Pg4-018" id="Pg4-018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
piety, whether such an one doth not give
them some ground to apprehend that he
is αυτοκατάκριτος, that is, self-judged, who
first calleth so eagerly for making out a
charge against him, and then when it is
made out, doth decline the charge, and not
answer the arguments; and such as esteem
the charge of covenant-breaking to be a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil respondes</span></span>, and the argument of
the covenant too low to be thought on in
a controversy about church government,
<span class="tei tei-q">“O my soul, come not thou into their
secret; unto their assembly, mine honour,
be not thou united.”</span> It is in vain for them
to palliate or shelter their covenant-breaking
with appealing from the covenant to
the Scripture, for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subordinata non pugnant</span></span>.
The covenant is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">norma recta</span></span>,—a
right rule, though the Scripture alone be
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">norma recti</span></span>,—the rule of right. If they
hold the covenant to be unlawful, or to
have anything in it contrary to the word
of God, let them speak out. But to profess
the breach of the covenant to be a grievous
and great fault, and worthy of a severe
censure, and yet to decline the charge
and proofs thereof, is a most horrible scandal;
yea, be astonished, O ye heavens, at
this, and give ear, O earth! how small
regard is had to the oath of God by men
professing the name of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for that little which the reverend
brother hath replied unto; first, he takes
notice of a passage of his sermon at the
taking of the covenant, which I had put
him in mind of, but he answereth only to
one particular, viz., concerning that clause,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Doubtless many materials of Prelacy must
of necessity be retained, as absolutely necessary.”</span>
I asked what he understood by this
clause? Now observe his answer: <span class="tei tei-q">“I answer
ingenuously, as he desires, and fully,
as I conceive, These materials of Prelacy are
ordination.”</span> Remember you said, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">many</span></span>
materials of Prelacy.”</span> I beseech you, Sir,
How many is ordination? Ordination, ordination,
ordination; tell on till you think
you have made many materials; and, withal,
tell us (if this be the meaning, that ordination
should be retained without any
power of ecclesiastical government in the
ministry) how was it imaginable that he
could hereby satisfy that scruple which then
he spoke to, viz., the scruple about the
purging away of the exorbitances of Prelacy,
and retaining a regulated Prelacy?
And after all this, I shall desire him to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-019">[pg 4-019]</span><a name="Pg4-019" id="Pg4-019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expound that other clause (which I desired
before, but he hath not done it),
<span class="tei tei-q">“Taking away (said he) the exorbitancies,
the remaining will be a new government,
and no Prelacy.”</span> Either he means this
of a new church government distinct from
the civil, so that the ministry should have
new power of government; or he meant
it of the way which now he pleads for.
If the former, I have what I would. Mr
Coleman himself, as well as other men,
took the covenant with an intention to
have an ecclesiastical government distinct
from the civil. If the latter, then let
him answer these two things: 1. What
good sense there was in applying such an
answer to such a scruple, as if the Erastian
way, or the appropriating of all ecclesiastical
jurisdiction wholly to the civil
magistrate, could be the way to satisfy
those who scrupled the total abolition of
Prelacy. 2. How will he reconcile himself
with himself; for here, p. 22, he saith, That
his way was in practice before I was born,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and the constant practice of England always.”</span>
This, as it is a most notorious untruth
(for the constant practice of England
hath granted to the clergy, as he calls
them, after the popish dialect, a power of
deposition and excommunication, whereas
his way denies all corrective power or
church censures to the ministry), so, if it
were a truth, it is utterly inconsistent with
that which he said of the remaining part,
namely, that it will be a new government.
If it be his way, how will he make it the
constant practice of England always, and
a new government too?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the next place, the reverend brother
makes short work of my five arguments to
prove the repugnancy of his doctrine to the
solemn league and covenant. They were
too hot for him to be much touched upon:
<span class="tei tei-q">“All is but this much (saith he), the covenant
mentioneth and supposeth a distinct
church government.”</span> It is hard when arguments
are neither repeated nor answered.
He repeats a point which was proved (and
but a part of that), but not the proofs; and
so he answereth (rather to the conclusion
than to the arguments) these two things:
<span class="tei tei-q">“First (saith he), the expressions in the covenant
are according to the general apprehensions
of the times, which took such a
thing for granted, yet I believe Mr Gillespie
cannot make such a supposition obligatory.”</span>
Now you yield, Sir, what before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-020">[pg 4-020]</span><a name="Pg4-020" id="Pg4-020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you eagerly contended against, viz., that the
covenant doth suppose a church government.
Remember your simile of the jury sworn to
inquire into the felony of a prisoner, which
oath doth not suppose the prisoner to be
guilty of felony, but he is to be tried, guilty
or not guilty. We are now so far agreed,
that the covenant doth suppose a church government
distinct from the civil government,
and yet not merely doctrinal, for that
was the point which I proved, and which
here he yields. As for the obligation of an
oath sworn upon such supposition, I answer,
1. It is more than supposed, the words and
expressions of the covenant do plainly hold out
the thing as I proved, and as the reverend
brother here seems to yield. 2. That which
an oath doth necessarily suppose, if the oath
be lawful, and the thing supposed lawful, is
without all controversy obligatory. Now
the reverend brother doth acknowledge
both the covenant itself to be a lawful oath,
and that which the covenant supposeth,
namely, a church government distinct from
the civil government, and yet not merely
doctrinal, to be a lawful thing; for he professeth
to yield it (though not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>,
yet) in prudence, which he cannot do, if he
make the thing unlawful. 3. That which
an oath doth suppose is sometimes supposed
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vi materiæ</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">consequentiæ</span></span>, that is, the
words of the oath do necessarily imply such
a thing, though it be not intended by the
swearer; and here I will tell Mr Coleman
one story of Alexander for another: When
Alexander was coming against a town to
destroy it, he met Anaximenes, who, as he
understood, came to make intercession and
supplication for sparing the town. Alexander
prevented him with an oath that he would
not do that thing which Anaximenes should
make petition for, whereupon Anaximenes
made petition that he would destroy the
town. Alexander found himself bound by
the plain words of his oath not to do what
he intended, and so did forbear. And to
add a divine story to an human, Joshua and
the princes of Israel did swear to the Gibeonites
upon a supposition that was not true,
yet they found themselves tied by their oath.
So he that sweareth to his own hurt must
not change, the oath being otherwise lawful,
Psal. xv. 4, yet that self-hurt which is wrapped
up in the matter of his oath was not intended
in swearing. Sometimes, again, that
which is supposed and implied in an oath,
lieth also in the thoughts and intentions of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-021">[pg 4-021]</span><a name="Pg4-021" id="Pg4-021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those that swear. Now, where those two are
coincident, that is, where the thing supposed
in an oath is both implied necessarily
in the words of the oath, and is also according
to the apprehensions of those that swear
(which is the case here in the covenant, and
is acknowledged by the reverend brother), I
should think it most strange how any divine
can have the least doubt concerning the
obligation of such a thing, except he conceive
the thing itself to be unlawful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His second answer is this: <span class="tei tei-q">“In my way
(saith he) the governments, civil and ecclesiastical,
are in the subject matter clearly
distinct. When the Parliament handles
matters of war, it is a military court; when
business of state, it is a civil court; when
matters of religion, it is an ecclesiastical
court.”</span> If this hold good, then it will follow,
1. That the Parliament, when they deliberate
about matters of war or matters of
religion, are not, at least formally and properly,
a civil court, else how makes he these
so clearly distinct? 2. That ministers may
be called civil officers, for consider his words
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>, p. 11: <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not
exclude ministers, neither from ecclesiastical
nor civil government, in a ministerial
way, doctrinally and declaratively.”</span> Compare
this with his present answer, it will
amount to thus much: That different denominations
being taken from the different
subject matter, ministers, when they handle
doctrinally matters of religion, are ecclesiastical
ministers; and when they handle doctrinally
matters of civil government, which
himself alloweth them to do, they are civil
ministers. But now to apply his answer to
the argument, How doth all this solve the
repugnancy of his doctrine to the covenant?
If he had examined my arguments, he had
found that most of them prove from the covenant
a church government distinct from
civil government, subjective as well as objective;
that is, another government besides
magistracy; different agents as well as
different acts; different hands as well as
handling of different matters. I know the
Christian magistrate may and ought to have
a great influence in matters of religion;
and whatsoever is due to him by the word of
God, or by the doctrine either of the ancient
or reformed churches, I do not infringe,
but do maintain and strengthen it.
But the point in hand is, that the covenant
doth undeniably suppose, and clearly hold
forth a government in the church distinct
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-022">[pg 4-022]</span><a name="Pg4-022" id="Pg4-022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from magistracy, which is proved by these
arguments (which, as they are not yet answered,
so I will briefly apply them to the
proof of that point which now Mr Coleman
sticks at): 1. The church covenant mentioned
in the covenant is as distinct from
the privileges of parliament, as the first article
of the covenant is distinct from the
third article. 2. The church government
in the first article of the covenant, the reformation
whereof we are to endeavour, differeth
from church government by archbishops,
bishops, &amp;c., mentioned in the second
article, as much as a thing to be reformed
differeth from a thing to be extirpated; so
that the church government formerly used
in the church of England is looked upon
two ways in the covenant, either <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua</span></span> church
government, and so we swear to endeavour
the reformation of it (which I hope was not
meant of reforming that part of the privileges
of Parliament whereby they meddle
with religion in a parliamentary way), or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua</span></span> church government, by archbishops,
bishops, &amp;c., and so we swear to endeavour
the extirpation of it. This difference between
the first and second articles, between
reformation and extirpation, proveth that
the covenant doth suppose that the church
government formerly used in the church of
England, in so far as it was a church government,
is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eatenus</span></span> to be abolished,
but in so far as it was a corrupt church government,
that is, prelatical. 3. Church
government, in the covenant, is matched
with doctrine, worship, and catechising.
Now these are subjectively different from
civil government, for the civil magistrate
doth not act doctrinally nor catechetically,
neither can he dispense the word and sacraments,
as Mr Coleman acknowledgeth. 4.
In the first part of the first article of the
covenant, concerning <span class="tei tei-q">“the preservation of
the reformed religion in the church of Scotland,
in doctrine, worship, discipline, and
government,”</span> it is uncontroverted, that discipline
and government are ecclesiastical,
and subjectively different from civil government,
that is, though divers who have a
hand in the civil government are ruling elders,
yet it is as true that divers members
of Parliament and inferior civil courts are not
church officers; and of the ministry none
are civil governors which makes the two governments
clearly distinct subjectively. Now
the second part of that article concerning
<span class="tei tei-q">“the reformation of religion in the kingdoms
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-023">[pg 4-023]</span><a name="Pg4-023" id="Pg4-023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of England and Ireland, in doctrine,
worship, discipline, and government,”</span> cannot
so far differ from the first part of that
article in the sense of the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“discipline
and government,”</span> as that the same words,
in the same article of the same covenant,
should signify things differing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span>,
which will follow, unless <span class="tei tei-q">“discipline and government”</span>
in the second branch, and <span class="tei tei-q">“form
of church government”</span> in the third branch,
be understood of the power of church officers,
and not of the magistrate. 6. We did
swear to <span class="tei tei-q">“endeavour the reformation of religion
in the kingdoms of England and Ireland,
in doctrine, worship, discipline and
government, according to the word of God
and the example of the best reformed
churches.”</span> Now the word of God holds
forth another government besides magistracy;
for Mr Coleman himself hath acknowledged,
that he finds in the New Testament
ministers to be rulers, yea, instituted
rulers; and the example of the best reformed
churches, without all doubt, leadeth
us to an ecclesiastical government different
from magistracy. Neither hath the reverend
brother so much as once adventured to allege
the contrary, except of the church of Israel,
which, as it is heterogeneous, being none of
the reformed churches mentioned in the
covenant, so it shall be discussed in due
place; from all which reasons I conclude,
that the wit of man cannot reconcile Mr
Coleman's doctrine with the covenant. 6.
I add a confutation of him out of himself,
thus: No such church government as Mr
Coleman casts upon an uncertainty, whether
the word hold out any such thing, can be,
by his principles, the power of magistracy
in things ecclesiastical, but another government
beside magistracy. But the church
government, mentioned in the first article
of the covenant, is such a church government
as Mr Coleman casts upon an uncertainty,
whether the word hold out any such
thing; therefore the church government
mentioned in the first article of the covenant
cannot be, by his principles, the power
of magistracy, but another government beside
magistracy. The proposition he will
easily admit, unless he alter his assertions;
the assumption is clear from his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination,</span></span>

DIVINITY.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr Hussey all along calls for divinity
schools: I confess himself hath much need of
them, that he may be better grounded in his
divinity; and that if he will plead any more
for Christian magistracy, he may not involve
himself into such dangerous heterodoxies as
have fallen from his pen in this short tractate.
I instance in these:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, In his epistle to the Parliament
he hath divers passages against synodical
votes; he will have no putting to the vote:
<span class="tei tei-q">“For votes (saith he, p. 6) are of no other
use but to gather parties, and ought nowhere
to be used but by those that have the
power of the sword.”</span> And, p. 3, he will
have the business of assemblies to be only
doctrinal, and <span class="tei tei-q">“by dispute to find out truth.
Their disputes ought to end in a brotherly
accord, as in Acts xv., much disputing, but
all ended in accord, no putting to the vote.”</span>
And, p. 5, he will have things carried
<span class="tei tei-q">“with strength of argument and unanimous
consent of the whole clergy.”</span> Behold
how he joineth issue with the remonstrants
against the contra-remonstrants, to introduce
not only an academical, but a sceptical
and Pyrrhonian dubitation and uncertainty,
so that there shall never be an end of
controversy, nor any settlement of truth and
of the ordinances of Jesus Christ, so long as
there shall be but one tenacious disputer to
hold up the ball of contention. One egg is
not liker another than Mr Hussey's tenet is
like that of the Arminians, for which see
the Synod of Dort, sess. 25.<a id="noteref_1356" name="noteref_1356" href="#note_1356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1356</span></span></a> It was the
ninth condition which the Arminians required
in a lawful and well-constituted synod,
that there might be no decision of the
controverted articles, but only such an accommodation
as both sides might agree to.
And, generally, they hold that synods ought
not to meet for decision, or determination,
but for examining, disputing, discussing;
so their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Examen Censurae</span></span>, cap. 25; and
their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vindiciae</span></span>, lib. 2, cap. 6, p. 131, 133.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, In that same epistle to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-025">[pg 4-025]</span><a name="Pg4-025" id="Pg4-025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Parliament, p. 4, he hath this passage:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will-worship is unlawful, I mean in matters
that are essential to God's worship,
which are matters of duty; as for circumstantials
of time and place, except the Sabbath,
which are matters of liberty, in these
the commonwealth may vote, &amp;c.; and this is
your Christian liberty, that in matters of liberty
ye make rules and laws to yourselves,
not crossing the ends that you are tied to in
duty.”</span> And is the Sabbath only a circumstantial
of time contradistinct from matters
of duty? It seems he will cry down not
only the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span> of church censures
with the Erastians, but the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jus divinum</span></span> of
the Sabbath with the Canterburians. And
if will-worship be unlawful only in the essentials
of God's worship, why was the argument
of will-worship so much tossed, not
only between Prelates and Nonconformists,
but between Papists and Protestants, even
in reference to ceremonies? And whether
hath not Mr Hussey here engaged himself
to hold it free and lawful to the Christian
magistrate, yea, to private Christians (for he
calls it Christian liberty, not parliamentary
liberty—now Christian liberty belongs to all
sorts of Christians), to make laws to themselves
for taking the sacrament anniversarily
on Christmas, Good-Friday, and Easter,
or to appoint a perpetual monthly fast
or thanksgiving; yea, another Parliament
may, if so it should seem good to them,
impose again the surplice and cross in baptism,
fonts, railing of communion tables, the
reading of divert passages of Apocrypha to
the congregations, doxologies, anthems, responsories,
&amp;c., as heretofore they were
used; or they may appoint all and every
one to sit in the church with their faces towards
the east, to stand up at the epistles
and gospels, &amp;c.; yea, what ceremonies,
Jewish, popish, heathenish, may they not
impose, provided they only hold the foundation,
and keep to those essentials which he
calls matters of duty? By restraining the
unlawfulness of will-worship to the essentials,
he leaves men free to do anything in
religion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">præter verbum</span></span>, so that it appear
not to them to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contra verbum</span></span>; anything
they may add to the word, or do beside
the word, so that the thing cannot be
proved contrary to the word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, Mr Hussey, ibid., p. 4, 5, saith,
That the Parliament may require such as
they receive for preachers of truth, <span class="tei tei-q">“to send
out able men to supply the places, and that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-026">[pg 4-026]</span><a name="Pg4-026" id="Pg4-026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
without any regard to the allowance or disallowance
of the people,”</span> where, in the
first part of that which he saith, there is
either a heterodoxy or a contradiction. A
heterodoxy, if he mean that ministers are
to be sent out without ordination: a contradiction,
if he mean that they must be ordained;
for then he gives classes a work
which is not merely doctrinal. But most
strange it is, that he so far departeth from
Protestant divines in point of the church's
liberty in choosing ministers. He tells us,
p. 14, that Mr Herle, <span class="tei tei-q">“for want of skill and
theological disputations,”</span> hath granted to
people a right to choose their minister. Mr
Herle's skill, both logical and theological, is
greater than it seems he can well judge of;
neither can this bold arrogant censure of his
derogate from Mr Herle's, but from his own
reputation. For the matter itself, it is one,
and not the least, of the controversies between
the Papists and Protestants, what
right the church hath in the vocation of
ministers: read Bellarmine, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Cleric.</span></span>, and
those that write against him, and see whether
it be not so. The Helvetic Confession
tells us that the right choosing of ministers
is by the consent of the church, and the
Belgic Confession saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“We believe that
the ministers, seniors and deacons, ought to
be called to those their functions, and by
the lawful elections of the church to be advanced
into those rooms.”</span> See both these
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harmony of Confessions</span></span>, sect. 11.
I might here, if it were requisite, bring a
heap of testimonies from Protestant writers;
the least thing which they can admit of is,
that a minister be not obtruded <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">renitente
ecclesia. Factum valet, fieri non debet.</span></span> It
may be helped after it is done, without making
null or void the ministry; but in a well-constituted
church there ought to be no intrusion
into the ministry, the church's consent
is requisite; for which also I might
bring both scripture and antiquity, but that
is not my present business. One thing I
must needs put Mr Hussey in mind of, that
when the prelates did intrude ministers,
without any regard to the disallowance of
the people, it was cried out against as an
oppression and usurpation, and we are often
warned by Mr Prynne, by Mr Coleman,
and by myself, to cast away the prelates'
usurpation with themselves. But who lords
it now over the Lord's inheritance, the
Presbyterians or the Erastians? Nay, he
who will have ministers put in churches
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-027">[pg 4-027]</span><a name="Pg4-027" id="Pg4-027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“without any regard to the allowance or
disallowance of people,”</span> falls far short of divers
prelatical men, who did much commend
the ancient primitive form of calling
ministers, not without the church's consent.
See Dr Field, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Of the Church</span></span>, lib. 5, cap.
54; Bilson, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Gubern. Eccl.</span></span>, cap. 15, p.
417; the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The History of Episcopacy</span></span>,
part 2, p. 360.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, Mr Hussey, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist.</span></span>, p. 7, saith,
That upon further consideration he found
<span class="tei tei-q">“the minister charged only with preaching
and baptising.”</span> The like he hath afterwards,
p. 39, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let any man prove that a
minister hath any more to do from Christ
than to teach and baptise.”</span> And again, p.
44, he propounds this query, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether
Christ gave any more government (he should
have said any more to do, for preaching and
baptising are not acts of government) than
is contained in preaching and baptising,”</span>
and he holds the negative. If only preaching
and baptising, then not praying and
reading in the congregation, ministering the
Lord's supper, visiting the sick and particular
families.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fifthly, He holdeth, p. 20, That a heathen
magistrate is unlawful, <span class="tei tei-q">“and for his
government, if sin be lawful, it is lawful.”</span>
A gross heterodoxy. The Apostle exhorteth
to be subject even to heathen magistrates,
Rom. xiii., for there were no other at
that time, and to pray for them, 1 Tim. ii.;
so that by Mr Hussey's divinity, the Apostle
would have men to be subject unto, and
to pray for an unlawful government. It is
an anabaptistical tenet, that an heathen magistrate
is not from God, which Gerhard,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Magistrate Politico</span></span>, p. 498, 499, fully
confutes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sixthly, He saith of Christ, p. 40, <span class="tei tei-q">“He
doth nothing as Mediator which he doth
not as God or as man.”</span> It is a dangerous
mistake, for take the work of mediation itself,
he neither doth it as God, nor as man,
but as God-man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seventhly, He saith, p. 35, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing
can be said of Christ as second person in
Trinity, in opposition to Mediator, but in
opposition to man there may.”</span> So that he
will not admit of this opposition. Christ, as
the Second Person in the Trinity, is equal
and consubstantial to the Father, but, as
Mediator, he is not equal to his Father, but
less than his Father, and subject and subordinate
to his Father—a distinction used by
our divines against the Anti-Trinitarians and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-028">[pg 4-028]</span><a name="Pg4-028" id="Pg4-028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Socinians. Now by his not admitting of
this distinction, he doth by consequence
mire himself in Socinianism; for Christ, as
Mediator, is the Father's servant, Isa. xlii.
1; and the Father is greater than he, John
xiv. 28; and as the head of the man is
Christ, so the head of Christ is God, 1 Cor.
xi. 3. If, therefore, it cannot be said of
Christ, as he is the Second Person in the
Trinity, that his Father is not greater than
he, and that he is not subordinate to God as
his head, then farewell Anti-Socinianism.
I dare boldly say, it is impossible to confute
the Socinians, or to assert the eternal Godhead
of Jesus Christ, except somewhat be
affirmed of him as the Second Person of
the Trinity, which must be denied of him
as he is Mediator, and something be denied
of him as he is the Second Person in the
Trinity, which must be affirmed of him as
he is Mediator.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eighthly, He saith, p. 36, That Christ,
<span class="tei tei-q">“by his mediation, hath obtained from the
Father that he shall not judge any man
according to rigour, but as they are in or
out of Christ; all deferring of judgment
from the wicked is in and for Christ, which
otherwise the justice of God would not allow.”</span>
Then Christ did thus far make satisfaction
to the justice of God in the behalf
of the wicked, and die for them, that judgment
might be deferred from them, and thus
far perform acts of mediation for the savages
and Mohammedans, and for them that
never heard the gospel, that by such mediation
he hath obtained of the Father that
they shall be judged not according to rigour,
but by the gospel. Which intimateth
that Christ hath taken away all their sins
against the law, so that all men shall now
go upon a new score, and none shall be condemned
or judged by the law, but by the
gospel only; for if Christ have not taken
away their sins against the law, the justice
of God will judge them according to the
rigour of the law. Must not every jot of
the law be fulfilled? And is there not a
necessity that every one undergo the curse
and rigour of the law, or else that the Mediator
hath undergone it for them?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ninthly, He propounds this query, p. 44:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Whether ministers have any right to those
privileges which are given to the church
more than another Christian,”</span> and he holds
the negative. Now the preaching of the
word, the administration of the sacraments,
and the power of the keys, are privileges
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-029">[pg 4-029]</span><a name="Pg4-029" id="Pg4-029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
given to the church, that is, for the church's
good: <span class="tei tei-q">“For all things are yours (saith the
Apostle), whether Paul, or Apollos,”</span> &amp;c.,
1 Cor. iii. 21, 22. Therefore, by Mr Hussey's
divinity, any other Christian hath as
much right to administer word, sacraments,
keys, as the minister.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Come on now to Mr Coleman's errors in
divinity, not to repeat what was expressed
in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>, but to take off
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span> in the main points.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tenthly, The tenth heterodoxy shall
therefore be this, That whatsoever is given
to Christ, he hath it not as the eternal
Son of God. Into this ditch did Mr
Coleman first fall, and then Mr Hussey,
p. 25, after him. I said this tenet leadeth
to a blasphemous heresy. For the better
understanding whereof let it be remembered
what I did promise in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil
Respondes</span></span>, p. 11, in reply to his proposition,
<span class="tei tei-q">“That which is given to Christ he
hath it not as God. This (said I) is in
opposition to what I said, p. 45, concerning
the headship and dignity of Christ, as the
natural Son of God, the image of the invisible
God, Col. i. 15, and, p. 43, of the
dominion of Christ, as he is the eternal Son
of God. This being premised,”</span> &amp;c. Mr
Coleman, without taking the least notice
of that which I did purposely and plainly
premise, begins to speak of God <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially</span></em>;
and that if something may be given
to Christ as God, then something may
be given to God, and then God is not absolutely
perfect, &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 13, 14.
Thus he turneth over to the essence and
nature of God what I spake of the Second
Person in the Trinity, or of Christ as he
is the eternal Son of God. Was not the
question between him and me, Whether
the kingdom and dominion over all things
may be said to be given to Christ as he is
the eternal Son of God. This is the point
which he did argue against, because it
takes off his argument first brought to
prove that all government, even civil, is
given to Christ as he is Mediator. And
still from the beginning I spake of Christ
as the Second Person in the Trinity, or
the eternal Son of God. Thus therefore
the case stands: The reverend brother, to
prove that an universal sovereignty and government
over all things is given to Christ
as he is Mediator, and to confute my assertion
that it is given to Christ as he is
the eternal Son of God, doth frame this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-030">[pg 4-030]</span><a name="Pg4-030" id="Pg4-030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
argument against me, <span class="tei tei-q">“That which is given
to Christ he hath it not as God. But
here dignity is given to Christ; therefore
not here to be taken as God;”</span> where
there is more in the conclusion than in the
premises; for the conclusion which naturally
follows had been this, Therefore Christ
hath not here dignity as God. It seems he
was ashamed of the conclusion, yet not of
the premises which infer the conclusion.
But this by the way. I speak to his proposition,
<span class="tei tei-q">“That which is given to Christ
he hath it not as God.”</span> These words <span class="tei tei-q">“as
God,”</span> either he understands οὐσιωδῶς, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially</span></span>,
or ἐπιστατικῶς, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">personally</span></span>; that
is, either in regard of the nature and essence
of God, which is common to the Son
of God with the Father and the Holy
Ghost, and in respect whereof they three
are one; or in regard of the person of the
Word, as Christ is the Second Person in
the Trinity, and personally distinct from
the Father and the Holy Ghost. If in the
former sense, then he must lay aside his
whole argument, as utterly impertinent, and
making nothing at all against my thesis,
which affirmed that an universal dominion
and kingdom over all things is given to
Christ, not as he is Mediator (in which
capacity he is only King of the church),
but as he is the eternal Son of God. In
opposing of which assertion, as the reverend
brother was before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil respondens</span></span>,
so now he is twice nought. But if in the
other sense he understands his proposition
(which I must needs suppose he doth, it
being in opposition to what I said), then I
still aver his proposition will infer a blasphemous
heresy, as I proved before by a
clear demonstration: That which is given
to Christ he hath it not as God. But life,
glory, &amp;c., is given to Christ; therefore
Christ hath not life, glory, &amp;c., as God.
The reverend brother saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“I acknowledge
the conclusion unsound, and I deny
not but that the major is mine own, and
the minor is the very Scripture.”</span> Yet he
denies the conclusion, and clears himself
by this simile, <span class="tei tei-q">“That which was given
this poor man he had not before. But a
shilling was given this poor man; therefore
he had not a shilling before: where
both propositions are true, yet the conclusion
is false (saith he), contrary to the
axiom, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex veris nil nisi verum</span></span>.”</span> You
are extremely out, Sir: your syllogism of
the poor man is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fallacia ab amphibolia</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-031">[pg 4-031]</span><a name="Pg4-031" id="Pg4-031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The major of it is ambiguous, dubious, and
fallacious, and cannot be admitted without
a distinction. But here you acknowledge
the major of my argument to be your own,
and so not fallacious in your opinion. You
acknowledge the minor to be Scripture.
You have not found four terms in my premises,
nor charged my major or minor with
the least fault in matter or form, and yet,
forsooth, you deny the conclusion, and do
not admit that incontrovertible maxim in
logic, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex veris nil nisi verum</span></span>; or, as Kekerman
hath it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex veris præemissis falsam
conclusionem colligi est impossibile</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1357" name="noteref_1357" href="#note_1357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1357</span></span></a>—It
is impossible that a false conclusion
should be gathered from true premises.
Now let us hear what he would say against
my conclusion;—it is concerning the sense
of the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hath</span></em>: <span class="tei tei-q">“For <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hath</span></em> (saith he)
by me is used for receiving or having by
virtue of the gift, but by him for having
fundamentally, originally.”</span> You are still
out, Sir. I take it just as you take it. For
though the Son of God, as God essentially,
or in respect of the nature and essence of
God, which is common to all Three Persons
in the blessed Trinity, hath originally
of himself a kingdom and dominion over
all; yet, as he is the Second Person in the
Trinity, begotten of, and distinct from the
Father, he hath the kingdom and dominion
over all not of himself, but by virtue
of the gift of his Father. So that the reverend
brother is still <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil respondens</span></span>, and
therefore he shall be concluded in this syllogism:
He who holds that whatsoever is
given to Christ he hath it not by virtue of
the gift, as he is the eternal Son of God or
Second Person in the Trinity, but only as
Mediator,—he holds, by consequence, that
Christ hath not glory by virtue of his Father's
gift, as he is the eternal Son of God
or Second Person in the Trinity. But Mr
Coleman holds the former; therefore Mr
Coleman holds the latter. The consequence
in the proposition is proved from John xvii.
22, <span class="tei tei-q">“The glory which thou gavest me.”</span>
The assumption he will own, or else quit
his argument against my distinction of the
double kingdom given to Christ, as he is
the eternal Son of God, and as Mediator.
The conclusion which follows is heretical;
for whereas the Nicene Creed said of Christ,
in regard of his eternal generation, that
he is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus de Deo, Lumen de lumine</span></span>,—God
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-032">[pg 4-032]</span><a name="Pg4-032" id="Pg4-032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of God, Light of light, Mr Coleman's
argument will infer that he is not
only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex seipso Deus</span></span>, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex seipso Filius</span></span>;
and so deny the eternal generation of the
Son of God, and the communication of the
Godhead, and the sovereignty, glory, and
attributes thereof, from the Father to the
Son. For if Christ, as he is the eternal
Son of God, hath not glory by virtue of
his Father's gift, then he hath it not by
virtue of the eternal generation and communication,
but fundamentally and originally
of himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for the other branch of Mr Coleman's
argument, tending to prove that
Christ, as he is the eternal Son of God,
cannot be given, which he endeavours to
vindicate, p. 14, 15, I answer these two
things:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, Granting all that he saith, he
concludes nothing against me; for I did
from the beginning expound these words,
Eph. i. 22, <span class="tei tei-q">“And gave him to be the
head over all things to the church,”</span> in this
sense, That Christ as Mediator is given
only to the church, to be her head, but
he that is given as Mediator to the church
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">over all</span></em>. So that the giving of Christ
there spoken of is as Mediator, and he is
given to the church only, which I cleared
by the Syriac, <span class="tei tei-q">“And him who is over all
he gave to be the head to the church.”</span>
But his being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">over all</span></em>, there spoken of, if
understood of glory, dignity, excellency over
all, so Christ is over all as Mediator (yea,
in regard of the exaltation of his human
nature), and this helpeth not Mr Coleman,
who intends to prove from that place that
all government, even civil, is given to Christ
as Mediator. But if understood of a kingdom
and government over all, so he is over
all, as he is the eternal Son of God or Second
Person of the Trinity, and not as
Mediator.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></span>, The question which the reverend
brother falls upon, concerning the personal
inhabitation of the Holy Ghost, will
never follow from anything which I said,
more than God's giving of his Son to us
will infer a personal inhabitation of the Son
of God in us. That which I said was to this
intent, That both the Son of God and the
Holy Ghost are given, not as God essentially;
that is, in respect of the Godhead itself,
or as they are one in nature with the Father
(for so the Father that giveth, and
the Holy Ghost which is given, could not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-033">[pg 4-033]</span><a name="Pg4-033" id="Pg4-033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be distinguished), but the Son is given as
the Son proceeding from the Father, and
the Holy Ghost is given as the Holy Ghost
proceeding and sent from the Father and
the Son. Whether he be given to dwell
personally in us, or by his gracious operations
only, is another question, which hath
nothing to do with the present argument,
and therefore I will not be led out of my way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eleventhly, The eleventh heterodoxy is
this: <span class="tei tei-q">“I see no absurdity to hold that
every man in authority is either Christ's
vicegerent, or the devil's.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p.
16. Here I make this inference: Heathen
and infidel magistrates, either, 1. They are
not men in authority; or, 2. They are
Christ's vicegerents; or, 3. They are the
devil's, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis.</span></span> If he say they are not
men in authority, he shall contradict the
apostle Paul, who calls them higher powers,
Rom. xiii. 1, and men in authority,
1 Tim. ii. 2, speaking in reference even to
the magistrates of that time, who were
infidels. If he say they are Christ's vicegerents,
then, 1. He must say, that Christ,
as Mediator, reigns without the church, and
is a king to those to whom he is neither
priest nor prophet. 2. He must find a commission
given by Christ to the infidel magistrate.
3. Whom in authority will he
make to be the devil's vicegerents if infidel
magistrates be Christ's vicegerents? If he
say that they are the devil's vicegerents,
then it follows, 1. That they who resist
the devil's vicegerent resist the ordinance
of God; for they that resist an infidel magistrate,
and do not submit to his lawful
authority (which his infidelity takes not
away), is said, Rom. xiii. 2, to resist the
ordinance of God. 2. That the apostle
Paul bade pray for the devil's vicegerent,
1 Tim. ii. 1, 2. The reverend brother
doth but more and more wind himself into
a labyrinth of errors, while he endeavours
to take away the distinction of the
twofold kingdom, and the twofold vicegerentship
of God and of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Twelfthly, The twelfth heterodoxy followeth:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now it is true that Christ, being
God as well as man, hath of himself originally,
as God, whatsoever he hath by virtue
of gift as Mediator,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 13. Now
subsume Christ hath, by virtue of gift, as
Mediator, the priestly office; therefore, by
Mr Coleman's principles, Christ hath of
himself originally, as God, the priestly office.
And if Christ hath it of himself originally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-034">[pg 4-034]</span><a name="Pg4-034" id="Pg4-034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as God, then the Father and the
Holy Ghost hath it also; so that by his
doctrine the Father and the Holy Ghost
shall be the priests of the church as well as
Christ, for Christ hath nothing of himself
originally as God which the Father and
the Holy Ghost have not likewise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirteenthly, The thirteenth and last
error concerneth the office of deacons. Not
only a widow but a deacon is denied to be a
church officer, or to have any warrant from
Scripture. <span class="tei tei-q">“I hold not a widow a church
officer (saith he); no more do I a deacon;
both having a like foundation in Scripture,
which is truly none at all,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis,</span></span> p.
9. If this was his opinion formerly, why
did he not in so main a point enter his dissent
from the votes of the Assembly concerning
deacons, together with his reasons?
Well, his opinion is so now, whereby he
runneth contrary not only to the reformed
churches (which it seems weigh not much
in his balance), but to the plain Scripture,
which speaks of the office of a deacon,
1 Tim. iii. 10; and this could be no civil
office, but an ecclesiastical office, for the
deacons were chosen by the church, were
ordained with prayer and laying on of
hands, and their charge was to take special
care of the poor; all which is clear,
Acts vi. If he had given us the grounds of
his opinion he should have heard more against
it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Mr Coleman, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>,
p. 14, makes the Parliament to be church
governors and church officers to the whole
kingdom. It was an argument used against
the prelates, that ecclesiastical and civil government,
spiritual and secular administrations,
are inconsistent in the same persons,
either of which requireth the whole man.
It was another exception against the prelate,
that he assumed the power of church
government and ecclesiastical jurisdiction
over the whole diocese, which was much
more than he could discharge. How will
Mr Coleman avoid the involving the Parliament
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-035">[pg 4-035]</span><a name="Pg4-035" id="Pg4-035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into prelatical guiltiness by his principles,
which we avoid by ours?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The prelates sought great things for
themselves rather than to purge the church
of scandals. What other thing was it when
Mr Coleman, in his third rule, instead of
exhorting to the purging the church, called
only for learning and competency, and told
it out, that this will <span class="tei tei-q">“get us an able ministry,
and procure us honour enough.”</span>
Mr Hussey, in his Epistle to myself, tells
me, that our attending on reading, exhortation
and doctrine (without government)
will obtain the magistrate's love, <span class="tei tei-q">“more
honour, more maintenance:”</span> something for
shame he behoved to add of the punishing
of sin (yet he will not have the minister
called from his study to be troubled or to
take any pains in discipline), but behold
the love of the magistrate; more honour
and more maintenance, are strong ingredients
in the Erastian electuary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Mr Hussey will have ministers placed
<span class="tei tei-q">“without any regard to the allowance or
disallowance of the people,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist. to the
Parliament.</span></span> This is prelatical, or rather
more than prelatical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The prelates were great enemies to
ruling elders: so are Mr Coleman and
Mr Hussey, who acknowledge no warrant
from the word of God for that calling, nor
admit of any ruling elders who are not
magistrates,—a distinction which was used
by Saravia and Bilson in reference to the
Jewish elders, and by Bishop Hall in reference
to the elders of the ancient church
who were not preaching elders, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assert. of
Episcop. by Divine Right</span></span>, p. 208, 209,
221,—and now, forsooth, Mr Hussey, in
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to the Parliament</span></span>, doth earnestly
beseech them to <span class="tei tei-q">“set up classes, consisting
only of ministers, whose work should
be only to preach the word,”</span> &amp;c. Such
classes, I dare say, the prelates themselves
will admit of. Sure the Scottish prelates,
when they were at their highest, yielded as
much.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr Coleman and Mr Hussey hold, that
ruling elders and a church government
distinct from the civil government, in the
times of persecution and under pagan magistrates,
can be no warrant for the like
where the state is Christian. This plea for
Christian magistracy was Bishop Whitgift's
plea against the ruling elders, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Answer to
the Admon.</span></span>, p. 114.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Mr Hussey, p. 22, saith, That granting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-036">[pg 4-036]</span><a name="Pg4-036" id="Pg4-036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the incestuous Corinthian to be excommunicated,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the decree was Paul's and not
the Corinthians',”</span> and that it no way appertained
to them under the notion of a church.
This is Saravia's answer to Beza, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Tripl.
Epist. Genere</span></span>, p. 42, 43, yea, the Papists'
answer to Protestant writers, by which they
would hold up the authority and sole jurisdiction
of the prelates, as the apostles' successors,
to excommunicate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They do not more agree with the prelatical
principles than they differ from the
votes and ordinances of Parliament, which is
the other point that I have here undertaken
to discover; and I shall do it by the particular
instances following:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, The ordinance of the Lords and
Commons assembled in Parliament, for the
calling of an assembly of divines, beginneth
thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whereas, among the infinite
blessings of Almighty God upon this nation,
none is, or can be, more dear unto us than
the purity of our religion, and for that as
yet many things remain in the liturgy, discipline,
and government of the church, which
do necessarily require a farther and more
perfect reformation than as yet hath been
attained: and whereas it hath been declared
and resolved, by the Lords and Commons
assembled in Parliament, that the present
church government, by archbishops, bishops,
&amp;c., is evil and justly offensive, &amp;c.; and
that, therefore, they are resolved that the
same shall be taken away, and that such a
government shall be settled in the church as
may be most agreeable to God's holy word,
and most apt to procure and preserve the
peace of the church at home, and nearer
agreement with the church of Scotland,
and other reformed churches abroad.”</span> After
it was resolved and voted in both the
honourable houses of Parliament, and sent
as one of the propositions to the treaty at
Uxbridge, <span class="tei tei-q">“That many particular congregations
shall be under one presbyterial government.”</span>
Now, therefore, what can be
more contrary to the votes and ordinances
of Parliament than that which Mr Coleman
and Mr Hussey hold, that there ought
to be no ecclesiastical government beside civil
magistracy, except we please to take
preaching and baptism under the name of
government, as if, forsooth, the Parliament
had meant, by presbyterial government,
Parliamentary government; or as if, by
the purity of religion in point of the discipline
of government of the church, they had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-037">[pg 4-037]</span><a name="Pg4-037" id="Pg4-037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
intended nothing but their civil rights and
privileges; or as if the wise and honourable
Houses had understood themselves no
better than to intend that for a nearer
agreement with the church of Scotland and
other reformed churches, which is the widest
difference from them, to wit, the Erastian
way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, In the same ordinance of Parliament
for the calling of an assembly of divines,
it is ordained that the assembly, after
conferring and treating among themselves
touching the liturgy, discipline, and government
of the church, or vindication and clearing
of the doctrine of the same, shall deliver
their opinions or advices of or touching the
matters aforesaid to both or either of the
houses of Parliament, yet Mr Hussey, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist.
to the Parliament</span></span>, p. 36, will not have classes
to put anything to the vote, but to hold
on the disputes till all end in accord, and
in unanimous consent of the whole clergy.
But how can the Assembly, after disputes,
express their sense, and deliver their opinions
and advice to the Parliament, as they
are required, except they do it by putting
to the vote? Mr Coleman himself hath
consented, yea, sometime called to put
things to the vote; and as for classes, will
any man imagine, that when both houses of
Parliament did vote <span class="tei tei-q">“that many particular
congregations shall be under one presbyterial
government,”</span> their meaning was, that
the classical presbytery shall only schoolwise
dispute, and put nothing to the vote;
or that the classical presbytery shall in common
dispense the word and sacraments to
many congregations, and that either the
classical presbytery shall go to the several
congregations successively, or the many congregations
come to the classical presbytery,
for preaching and baptising? I admire
what opinion Mr Hussey can have of the
Parliamentary vote concerning presbyterial
government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, Mr Hussey, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to the Parliament</span></span>,
p. 4, 5, will have ministers placed
<span class="tei tei-q">“without any regard to the allowance and
disallowance of the people,”</span> yet the ordinance
of Parliament, for giving power to
classical presbyteries to ordain ministers,
doth appoint that he who is examined and
approved by the presbytery shall be <span class="tei tei-q">“sent
to the church or other place where he is to
serve (if it may be done with safety and
conveniency), there to preach three several
days, and to converse with the people, that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-038">[pg 4-038]</span><a name="Pg4-038" id="Pg4-038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they may have trial of his gifts for their edification,
and may have time and leisure to
inquire into, and the better to know his life
and conversation,”</span> after which the ordinance
appointeth public notice to be given, and a
day set to the congregation to put in what
exceptions they have against him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, Mr Hussey in that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to
the Parliament</span></span>, p. 5, saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh that this
honourable court would hasten to set up
classes consisting only of ministers whose
work should be only to preach the word,
and weekly meet in schools of divinity!”</span>
Here is a double contradiction to the ordinances
of Parliament, for in the directions of
the Lords and Commons for choosing of ruling
elders, and speedy settling of presbyterial
government, it is appointed that ruling
elders shall be members both of classes and
synodical assemblies, together with the ministers
of the word. Again, the ordinance
about suspension of scandalous persons from
the sacrament appointeth other work to
classes, beside preaching and disputing,
namely, the receiving and judging of appeals
from the congregational eldership.
Mr Coleman, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 12, professeth
that he excludeth ruling elders from
church government, yet he can hardly be
ignorant that as the Parliament hath voted
<span class="tei tei-q">“that many particular congregations shall
be under one presbyterial government,”</span> so
their votes do commit that government to
pastors and ruling elders jointly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will not here repeat the particulars
wherein I showed in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>
that Mr Coleman hath abused the honourable
houses of Parliament, unto which particulars
he hath answered as good as nothing.
The honourable houses, in their wisdom,
will soon observe whether such men,
whose avouched tenets are so flatly repugnant
to the parliamentary votes and ordinances,
are like to be good pleaders for
Christian magistracy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr Coleman ends his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span> with a
resentment of accusations charged upon him
by a stranger, a commissioner from another
church. The lot of strangers were very
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-039">[pg 4-039]</span><a name="Pg4-039" id="Pg4-039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hard, if, when they are falsely accused to
authority, they may not answer for themselves.
He may remember the first accusation
was made by himself, when in his sermon
to the Parliament, he did flatly impute
to the commissioners from the church of
Scotland a great part of the fault of hindering
union in the Assembly of Divines, as
having come biassed with a national determination;
his doctrine also at that time being
such, as did not only reflect upon the
government of the church of Scotland, but
tend to the subversion of the covenant in
one principal point, without which there can
be small or no hopes of attaining the other
ends of the covenant. Since that time he
did in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>, and now again
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, fall foully upon the church
of Scotland, not only by gross mistakes and
misrepresentations of our way, but by most
groundless aspersions and most uncharitable
and unjust calumnies. I am sure I am not
so much a stranger to this doctrine as he is
to the church of Scotland, of which notwithstanding
he boldly speaks his pleasure in
divers particulars, which he will never be
able to make good.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, He hath aspersed that church in
the point of promiscuous communicating.
This I confuted in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>:
and told him both of the order of the
church and practice of conscientious ministers
to the contrary. Now what replieth
he?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, This refining work, I think, is
not one year old in Scotland, or much
more. I was lately informed that in Edinburgh
it is begun: whether anywhere else
I know not,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 20. Are not
these now good grounds of censuring and
aspersing a reformed church (whose name
hath been as precious ointment among other
churches abroad), <span class="tei tei-q">“I think; I was informed;
whether it be otherwise I know not?”</span>
He will sit in Cornhill, and tell the world
what he imagines or hears of the church of
Scotland, and that, forsooth, must be taken
for a truth. Yet there was both rules and
practice in the church of Scotland for debarring
ignorant and scandalous persons
from the sacrament before he was born,
though all was put out of course under the
prelates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></span> (saith the reverend brother),
It is not a very effectual sin-censuring and
church-refining government, under which,
after fourscore years' constant practice, divers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-040">[pg 4-040]</span><a name="Pg4-040" id="Pg4-040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thousands in the kingdom, and some
hundreds in one particular parish, because
of ignorance and scandal, are yet unfit to
communicate,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 20. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ans.</span></span> 1.
It is notoriously false that there hath been
fourscore years' constant practice of presbyterial
government in Scotland; for the prelates
there were above thirty years' standing.
2. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall the earth be made to bring
forth in one day, or shall a nation be born
at once?”</span> saith the prophet, Isa. lxvi. 8.
It is no easy matter to get a whole nation
purged of ignorant and scandalous persons.
3. He may take notice that the apostle
Paul, almost in all his epistles, maketh mention
of scandalous persons among those to
whom he wrote, warning them not to have
fellowship with such, to note them, to avoid
them. If the apostolic churches were not free
of such, what great marvel if we be not? 4.
Before he objected promiscuous communicating.
This being cleared to be a calumny,
now he objecteth that there are such as are
unfit to communicate. But while he thus
seeketh a quarrel against church government,
he doth upon the matter quarrel the
preaching of the gospel itself; for he that
imputeth it as a fault to the church government
that there are still divers thousands
who, by reason of ignorance or scandal, are
unfit to communicate, doth, by consequence,
yea, much more, impute it as a fault to the
preaching of the gospel in England, Scotland,
Ireland, France, Germany, the Low
Countries, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland,—that
in all these, and other reformed churches,
after fourscore years' constant preaching
of the gospel (which is appointed of God to
turn unconverted and unregenerate persons
from darkness to light, and from the power
of Satan to God), there are not only divers
thousands, but divers millions, who, by reason
of ignorance or scandal, are yet unfit to
communicate. If the word do not open the
eyes of the ignorant, and convert the scandalous,
what marvel that church government
cannot do it? Church government is
not an illuminating and regenerating ordinance
as the word is. But this church government
can and will do, yea, hath done,
where it is duly executed: It is a most
blessed means for keeping the ordinances
from visible and known pollution, which
doth very much honour God, shame sin,
and commend piety; it putteth a visible
difference between the precious and the
vile, the clean and the unclean, the silver
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-041">[pg 4-041]</span><a name="Pg4-041" id="Pg4-041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the dross; and may well be, therefore,
called a church-refining ordinance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, The second calumny was this,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I myself (said he) did hear the presbytery
of Edinburgh censure a woman to be
banished out of the gates of the city.”</span> I
answered him in his own language, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
at the best a most uncharitable slander:”</span>
and told him there is no banishment in
Scotland but by the civil magistrate; and
that he ought to have inquired and informed
himself better.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now he doth neither adhere to his calumny,
or offer to make it good, nor yet
quit it, or confess he was mistaken, but propoundeth
three new queries (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>,
p. 21), still forgetting his own rule of keeping
to the laws of disputation and matter in
hand. For the particular in hand he only
saith thus much, <span class="tei tei-q">“I did make inquiry, and
from the presbytery itself I received information,
but not satisfaction.”</span> He tells not
what information he received. If he will
say that he received information that the
banishment was by the magistrate, how
could he then report that it was by the
presbytery. If he say that the information
he had from the presbytery gave him any
ground for the report which he hath made,
let him speak it out, and the world shall
know the untruth of it. He may remember,
withal, that by his principles an accusation
may not be received against an elder
(much less against an eldership), in reference
either to the judgment of charity, or
to ministerial conviction, except under two
or three witnesses. If, therefore, he would
have his accusation believed, let him find
two or three witnesses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, Whereas I had rectified a great
mistake of the reverend brother when I
told him, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is accidental to the ruling
elder to be of the nobility, or to nobles to
be ruling elders; there are but some so,
and many otherwise,”</span> he is not pleased to
be rectified in this, but replieth, <span class="tei tei-q">“I say,
first, It is continually so; secondly, The
king's commissioner in the General Assembly,
is his presence accidental?”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male
Dicis</span></span>, p. 10. See now here whether he
understandeth what he saith, or whereof he
affirmeth. That which he saith is continually
so, is almost continually otherwise;
that is, there are continually some ruling
elders who are not nobles, and there are
continually some nobles who are not ruling
elders. So that, if anything be accidental,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-042">[pg 4-042]</span><a name="Pg4-042" id="Pg4-042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this is accidental, that an elder be of the
nobility, or nobles be elders; they are neither
nobles <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua</span></span> elders, nor elders <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua</span></span> nobles.
It is no less accidental that the king's
commissioner be present in the General Assembly;
for there have been General Assemblies
in Scotland, both before the erection
and since the last casting out of Prelacy,
in which there was no commissioner
from the king. And when the king sends
a commissioner, it is accidental that he be
of the nobility; for the king hath sent commissioners
to General Assemblies who were
not of the nobility.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, A fourth injury, not to be
passed in silence, is this: Mr Coleman
hath endeavoured to make the world believe
that the commissioners from the church
of Scotland came to the Assembly biassed
with something adventitious from without,
which he calls a national determination, and
that we are not permitted by those that
sent us to receive any further light from
the word of God. I shall say no more of
the bias, because, as I told him before, the
standers by see well enough which way the
bias runs. But most strange it is, that after
I had confuted his calumny, not only from
our paper first presented to the grand committee,
but from the General Assembly's
own letter to the Assembly of Divines,
showing that they had ordered the laying
aside of some particular customs in the
church of Scotland, for the nearer uniformity
with the church of England, so much
endeared unto them, yet he still adhereth
to his former calumny (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 20),
without taking notice of the evidence which
I had given to the contrary. And not content
with this, he still quarrelleth with my
allegation of certain parallel examples, which
are by him so far disesteemed, that he hath
not stuck to pass the very same censure upon
the foreign divines who came to the
Synod of Dort which the Arminians did.
The same he saith of Alexander's coming
to the Council of Nice, and of Cyril's coming
to the Council of Ephesus; all these, I
say, he still involveth under the same censure
with us; for whereas he had alleged
that I justified the bias, this I denied, and
called for his proof. His reply now is thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is not the allegation of the examples of the
like doing a justification of the act done?”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>, p. 20. This reply can have
no other sense but this, That I justified the
thing which he thinks our bias, because I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-043">[pg 4-043]</span><a name="Pg4-043" id="Pg4-043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
justified those other divines who (as he
holds) came also biassed in like manner.
I am persuaded this one particular, his joining
with the Arminians in their exceptions
against the Synod of Dort, would make all
the reformed churches, if they could all
speak to him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">uno ore</span></span>, to cry <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male audis</span></span>.
And I am as firmly persuaded that the
confession which I have extorted from him
in this place, that he knoweth no adventitious
engagements those divines had, makes
him irreconcileably to contradict himself;
for he made them but just now biassed in
the same manner as he thinks us, and made
my allegation of their examples to be a justification
of the bias charged by him upon
us: as, therefore, he doth must uncharitably
and untruly judge us to be biassed
with adventitious engagements, so doth he
judge of them. Neither can he assoil them
while he condemneth us; for the articles concerning
predestination, the death of Christ,
grace, free will, and perseverance, were determined
before the Synod of Dort by most
(if not by all) of those reformed churches
who sent commissioners thither, as much as
presbyterial government was determined in
the church of Scotland before the reverend
Assembly of Divines was called. And this
pre-engagement and predetermination of
those reformed churches was the main objection
of the Arminians against the foreign
divines who came to the Synod of Dort. To
conclude this point, Mr Coleman himself, in
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>, p. 7, avoucheth roundly,
that the foreign divines came to Dort,
not as divines, by dispute and disquisition to
find out truth, but as judges, to censure all
different opinions as erroneous.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr Hussey, in his title page, tells us he
hath prosecuted the argumentative part
without any personal reflections, yet I could
instance divers personal reflections in his
book which any moderate impartial man
will extremely dislike; but what should
this be to the edifying of my reader, the
end which, next to the glory of God and
the promoting of reformation, I have proposed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-044">[pg 4-044]</span><a name="Pg4-044" id="Pg4-044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to myself? Yet I must needs take
notice of some calumnies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle</span></span>, p. 8, he offereth it
to be examined whether I was not beside
my text, Mal. iii. 2, when I pressed from it
reformation by ecclesiastical discipline: whether
that refiner's fire and fuller's soap doth
not point at another and a nearer operation
upon the souls and spirits of men by the
blood, word, Spirit, and grace of Christ:
and whether such handling of a similitude
in a text be to preach the mind of God, or
men's own fancy. It is no discontent to me,
but I shall rejoice in it, that men of piety
and judgment examine my doctrine by the
word of God, and hold fast what they find
agreeable to the Scriptures, and no more.
But is this brotherly, or fair, or conscionable
dealing, to offer my sermon to be examined
under such a notion, when he hath
not only said nothing to confute any of
my doctrines, as not arising from my text,
or any of my applications, as not arising
from my doctrines; but hath also untruly
represented my sermon, as coming short of,
or not expressing that which indeed it hath
most principally and most expressly in it?
That of reformation was but a part of my
sermon; and that of church censures, against
scandalous sinners, was but the least part of
that part. And why should not the fuller's
soap in the house of God, take off those
spots in our feasts? Why should not the
refiner's fire purge away the wicked of the
earth like dross? so David calls them. That
reformation is one part of the Holy Ghost's
intendment in that text, is Gualther's opinion
as well as mine, yet he thinks Gualther
his own. Nay, I proved it from comparing
scripture with scripture, which is the
best way that I know to clear scripture.
Why did he not answer my proofs? But
beside all that I said of reformation, had I
not other three doctrines out of that text
comprehending all that which Mr Hussey
hinteth as omitted by me, and yet intended
in the text? Dare he say that I did not
take in purgation by the word? (though I
confess he doth not well prove it from the
words which he citeth, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not my word an
hammer?”</span> But it is proved by the words
which he citeth not, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not my word like
as a fire?”</span>) Did I not expressly say that
Christ is to us as a refiner's fire and as fuller's
soap three ways,—by reformation, by
tribulation, by mortification? Did I not
handle the last two as well as the first? Oh
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-045">[pg 4-045]</span><a name="Pg4-045" id="Pg4-045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
let no more such gross calumnies be found
among those who profess to be brethren!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, Mr Hussey, in his epistle to
myself, gives it out that I say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We have
leave from the civil magistrate to preach the
gospel,”</span> which he interprets as if I denied
that we preach the word with authority from
Christ. It was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span>, not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de jure</span></span>, that
I spake it. The magistrate hath power in
his hand to hinder both doctrine and discipline,
if he be an adversary, though it be
the will of Christ that there be both doctrine
and discipline, and the authority of
both is from Christ. When the magistrate
assisteth or countenanceth, or so much as
doth not hinder the preaching of the gospel,
then he gives leave to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, Mr Coleman, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>,
p. 3, saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am confident the church of
Scotland sent this Commissioner to dispute
down our reasons, not to revile our persons.”</span>
Why did he not, if he could, give instance of
some reviling word written by me against
his person? I have not so learned Christ.
The Lord rebuke every railing and reviling
spirit. I have given him reason against
railing; he hath given me railing against
reason; I spake to his doctrine, he speaks
to my place and relation, which is both the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omega</span></span>
of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Knowledge (saith he) is only
with Mr Gillespie; others understand neither
what they say, nor whereof they affirm,”</span>
p. 3. He will sooner bring water
out of flint than prove this consequence out
of my title-page. Although I confess himself
hath affirmed divers things of the
church of Scotland which he doth not understand,
as I have made plainly to appear.
If he take a review of the title-page of his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Re-examination</span></span>, he gives more ground for
this consequence,—that Mr Coleman is the
only man that denies himself; others seek
great things for themselves. Or from the
title-page of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span> this consequence
will be as good,—that Mr Coleman is the
only man that blesseth; others are revilers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fifthly, Thus saith Mr Coleman, <span class="tei tei-q">“O ye
honourable house of Parliament, take you
notice that you manage that great place of
yours under Christ and for Christ: He is
your head, and you are his servants; and
take you notice withal that Mr Gillespie
accounts this your reproach,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis
Maledicis</span></span>, p. 17. But O ye honourable
house of Parliament, be pleased to take notice
of my own plain expression of my mind
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-046">[pg 4-046]</span><a name="Pg4-046" id="Pg4-046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes.</span></span> p. 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Christian magistrate manageth his office
under and for Christ, that is, so as to be
serviceable for the kingdom and glory of
Christ.”</span> And now judge whether it be
suitable to the sincerity and candour of a
minister of the gospel to endeavour to make
me odious to authority, by imputing to me
that which not only I did not say, but the
contrary whereof I did plainly express.
The thing which I charged his doctrine
with was this, that by holding all government
to be given to Christ as Mediator,
and from him, as Mediator, derived to the
magistrate as his vicegerent, he shaketh the
foundation of magistracy. I am sure that
which I hold, that all lawful magistrates are
powers ordained by God, and are to be
honoured and obeyed as God's vicegerents,
is a firm and strong foundation for magistracy.
But that which Mr Coleman and
Mr Hussey hold, viz., that the Christian magistrate
holdeth his office of, under, and for
Christ, as he is Mediator, and doth act <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
Christi</span></span>, as Christ's vicegerent, gives a most
dangerous wound to Christian magistracy,
which I can demonstrate in many particulars.
I shall now give instance only in these
few: First, They must prove from Scripture
that Christ, as Mediator, hath given a
commission of vicegerentship to Christian
magistrates, and appointed them not only to
be serviceable to him, and to do his work
(for that they must serve Christ, and be for
his glory, is not controverted, nay, can never
enough be commended to them), but also to
govern <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice Christi</span></span>, in Christ's stead, and
that not only as he is God, which is not controverted
neither, but as he is Mediator.
This, I say, they must prove, which they
will never be able to do, or otherwise they
do, by their doctrine, lead the magistrate
into a snare, and leave him in it. For how
shall he be acknowledged for a vicegerent
who can show no commission nor warrant
for his vicegerentship? Secondly, Their
doctrine tendeth to the altering of the surest
and best known tenure of magistracy,
which is from God; for they hold that God
hath put all government, and all authority
civil, and all, into the hands of Christ as
Mediator; if the tenure from Christ fail,
then, by their doctrine, the tenure from
God shall fail too. Thirdly, The vicegerent
cannot act in that capacity, nor assume
that power which his sovereign, whose vicegerent
he is, ought not to assume if he were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-047">[pg 4-047]</span><a name="Pg4-047" id="Pg4-047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
personally present; so that, by their principles,
it will follow that the Christian magistrate
can act no farther, nor assume any
other power of government, than Christ
himself might have assumed when he was
on earth, or might now assume and exercise
as Mediator if he were on earth. But
Christ himself, when he was on earth, neither
did exercise, nor was sent to exercise,
civil judgment, Luke xii. 14; and the temporal
sword, John xviii. 36; nor external
observation and state, Luke xvii. 20, 21;
and he declined to be an earthly king, John
vi. 15. Therefore, by their principles, the
Christian magistrate ought to forbear and
avoid all these.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A sixth calumny is this: Mr Coleman,
descanting upon the governments mentioned
1 Cor. xii. 28, chargeth me with a
circular argumentation: <span class="tei tei-q">“He circularly argues
(saith he): they are civil, because God
placed them there, and God placed them
there because they are civil,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis
Maledicis</span></span>, p. 9. I neither argued the one
nor the other; they are both, Sir, of your
own forging. But this is not your first allegation
of this kind. I sometime admire
what oscitancy or supine negligence (to
judge it no worse) this can be, to fancy to
yourself that I have said what you would,
and then to bring forth your own apprehensions
for my arguments.

For much of what is reported
of my sermon I utterly deny,
and refer myself to the sermon
itself, for what I have acknowledged
to be delivered by me,
although it is my judgment, yet
because I see it hath given a
great deal of offence to this

sorry I have given offence in
the delivery thereof; and for
the printing, although I have
an order, I will forbear, except

Surely if such Orleans glosses be admitted
upon men's declarations, signed with their
hands, and if he who hath subscribed himself
sorry that he hath given offence in the
delivery of such a doctrine, shall be allowed
to expound himself thus; that he meant he
was sorry others had taken offence at a
Scripture truth, that is, he was sorry for our
fault, not for his own. I know not how
men shall trust one another's declarations,
or how we can practically, as well as doctrinally,
confute the Jesuitical equivocations
and mental reservations. And if this must
needs be the sense which now the reverend
brother gives, and was the sense intended,
why saith he that he did publicly recal
that declaration? He might make a revocation
of it, in the sense wherein I understood
it: but how could he make a revocation
of it as himself understood it, and as he
saith the sense must needs be? Was this his
sorrow for our taking offence at a Scripture
truth, a sorrow to be sorrowed for? Why
did he not rather make a second declaration
the next day interpreting the former? And
whereas he thinks that his revocation ought
to have been mentioned together with his
declaration, because the whole truth is to
be told as well as the truth, his own heart
knows that he himself hath not told the
whole truth, for he could tell much more if
he pleased, how he was brought upon the
business, and particularly upon that revocation.
Why will he challenge others for not
telling the whole truth, when himself doth
it not? I should have thought that this revocation
was neither here nor there as to
the point of scandal, for proof whereof his
declaration was brought; and that, as it was
not to the business in hand, so it might rather
serve for impairing his credit than for
anything else. But seeing himself thinks it
more for his credit to tell the world of his
saying and unsaying, declaring and undeclaring,
let him be doing.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the next place, Will you see how much
violence he offereth to divines whom he citeth?
I had cited plain and full testimonies
of the Zurich divines, showing that Gualther
expounds 1 Cor. v. all along of excommunication;
that Bullinger holds excommunication
to be instituted by Christ, Matt.
xviii.; that Aretius saith God was the author
of excommunication in the Old Testament,
and Christ in the New, all which see
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil Respondes</span></span>, p. 32.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reverend brother, notwithstanding
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-049">[pg 4-049]</span><a name="Pg4-049" id="Pg4-049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of their plain testimonies, speaking for me
and against him in the main controversy between
him and me, doth still allege that
they are for him, not for me, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Male Dicis</span></span>,
p. 23, yet he doth not so much as offer any
answer to their testimonies by me cited,
only he bringeth three other passages of
theirs, intimating that there may be a true
church without excommunication; that they
thought it not necessary where they lived;
that they thought it hard, yea impossible—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">arduum
nec non impossible</span></span>—to introduce
excommunication in those parts, by which
citations the brother hath proved nothing
against me, but confirmed what I said.
Let him remember first, he himself makes
the main controversy between him and me
about the scriptural warrants of church censures,
now in that they are clearly against
him. Next Aretius, who thought it hard,
yea impossible, to bring in excommunication
at that time, saith also, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dabit posterior
aetas tractabiliores forte animas</span></span>,—peradventure
the following age shall bring
forth more tractable souls; and thereupon
he adviseth not to despair of the restitution
of excommunication. I cited also other
testimonies to show that the Zurich divines
did endeavour and long for the discipline of
excommunication, though as things stood
then and there, they did prudentially supersede
the restoring of it where they lived,
because of the difficulty and apprehended
impossibility of the thing. If Mr Coleman
will follow the Zurich divines he must change
his tone, and quite alter the state of the
question, and make it thus: Whether, as
things now stand, it be expedient to settle
excommunication in the church of England.
Now if he makes this the state of the question,
then he must make a revocation of that
word, <span class="tei tei-q">“I deny an institution, I assent to a
prudence.”</span> For the tables were turned
with the Zurich divines; they assented to
an institution; they denied a prudence;
they held an affirmative precept for excommunication,
but that it doth not bind <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad
semper</span></span>, that the thing is not at all times,
nor in all places necessary; that weighty inconveniences
may warrant the superseding
of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reverend brother brings another testimony
out of Aretius against suspension
from the sacrament: <span class="tei tei-q">“And further (saith
he) for this grand desired power, suspension
from sacrament, these are his words,”</span> &amp;c.
A testimony three ways falsified: 1. Aretius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-050">[pg 4-050]</span><a name="Pg4-050" id="Pg4-050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
speaks not at all in that place of the power
or duty of church officers, of which suspension
is a part, but he speaks of private
Christians, and what is incumbent to them.
2. He speaks of separation, not of suspension
from the sacrament; that a man is not
bound to withdraw and lie off from the
sacrament, because every one who is to communicate
with him is not in his opinion a
saint. 3. He speaketh against separation
from both word and sacrament, because of
the mixture of good and bad in hearing and
in communicating; but scandalous sinners
are invited to, not suspended from the hearing
of the word, wherefore take Aretius's<a id="noteref_1358" name="noteref_1358" href="#note_1358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1358</span></span></a>
words as they are, and then let the reverend
brother consider what he hath gained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What hath this now to do with church
officers' power of suspension from the
sacrament?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Observe another testimony which he addeth
out of Augustine, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lib. de Fide, Excommunicatio
debet supplere locum visibilis
gladii</span></span>, which he Englisheth thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Excommunication comes in only to supply
the want of the civil sword.”</span> But how
comes in your <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>, Sir? Augustine saith
no such thing. And when I have expunged
that word, I must tell you farther, that I
can find no such passage in Augustine's
book <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Fide</span></span>; but I find somewhat to this
purpose in another book of his, which is entitled
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Fide et Operibus</span></span>, a book which
he wrote against the admission of such persons
to baptism, as being instructed in the
faith, are, notwithstanding, still scandalous
in their lives (which, by the way, will hold
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a fortiori</span></span>, for the exclusion of notorious
scandalous sinners from the Lord's supper;
for they who ought not to be admitted to
the sacrament of initiation, ought much less
to be admitted to the sacrament of confirmation).
Now because divers scriptures
speak of a mixture of good and bad in the
church, Augustine takes there occasion to
reprove those who abused these scriptures
against the exercise of discipline and church
censures, the necessity whereof he showeth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-051">[pg 4-051]</span><a name="Pg4-051" id="Pg4-051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to be the greater, because the magistrate
doth not punish by death all such crimes as
under the law were punished by death,
as, namely, adultery, the scandal chiefly by
him insisted upon. As for that passage
concerning excommunication supplying the
place of the sword,<a id="noteref_1359" name="noteref_1359" href="#note_1359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1359</span></span></a> it plainly holds forth
excommunication under Christian emperors
and magistrates, for such they were at that
time, so far it is from making against us.
For these are the words which say no such
thing as Mr Coleman would make them
say: <span class="tei tei-q">“And Phinehas the priest did thrust
through the adulterous persons found together
with the avenging sword;”</span> which signified
that it should be none by degradations
and excommunications in this time, when,
in the discipline of the church, the visible
sword was to cease.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the reverend brother had let me know
where to find his other testimonies of Origen
and Chrysostom, peradventure I had
given him as good an account of them. Tertullian's<a id="noteref_1360" name="noteref_1360" href="#note_1360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1360</span></span></a>
words which he citeth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Praesident
probati seniores</span></span>, I know very well where
to find; and I know also, that if there be
a passage in all antiquity against the Erastians,
that is one. Which therefore I here
offer as it is to be considered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One instance more of his misalleging
and perverting of testimonies. In the close,
he citeth a passage of Mr Case's sermon,
Aug. 22, 1645. <span class="tei tei-q">“He (Christ) is king of
nations and king of saints. As king of nations
he hath a temporal kingdom and
government over the world,”</span> &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-q">“and the
rule and regiment of this kingdom he hath
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4-052">[pg 4-052]</span><a name="Pg4-052" id="Pg4-052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
committed to monarchies,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is
Erastianism (saith Mr Coleman, p. 38), a
step higher than ever I or Erastus himself
went. And I desire to know of Mr Gillespie,
if he will own this as good divinity?”</span>
Yes, Sir, I own it for very good divinity;
for my reverend brother, Mr Case, saith
not that Christ, as Mediator, is king of nations,
and hath a temporal kingdom in the
world, and hath committed rule and regiment
to monarchies or other lawful magistrates
(which is the point that you and Mr
Hussey contend for, being a great heterodoxy
in divinity), but he saith of the Son of
God, that he is king of nations, and hath
committed rule to monarchies, which I own
with all my heart. The distinction of the
twofold kingdom of Christ,—an universal
kingdom, whereby he reigneth over all things
as God, and a special economical kingdom,
whereby he is king to the church only, and
ruleth and governeth it,—is that which, being
rightly understood, overturneth, overturneth,
overturneth the Erastian principles.
Let Mr Coleman but own this distinction,
and that which Mr Case addeth concerning
the kingdom, which Christ, as king of saints
(and so as Mediator), doth exercise both invisibly,
in the conscience, and visibly, in the
church: First, By conquering a people and
visible subjects; secondly, By giving them
laws distinct from all the laws and statutes
of all the kingdoms and republics in the
world, Isa. xxxiii. 22; thirdly, By constituting
special officers in the church not only
to promulgate these laws, Matt, xviii. 19,
but to govern his people according to them,
Acts xx. 28; Rom. xii. 8; 1 Cor. xii. 28;
xiv. 32; fourthly, In that he hath commanded
all his people to obey these ecclesiastical
officers, Heb. xiii. 7, 17; fifthly,
And hath appointed censures proper to this
government, Matt, xviii. 17; 1 Cor. v. 13:
I say, let Mr Coleman but own this doctrine
of Mr Case, which was printed by order of
the honourable House of Commons as well
as his was, then we are agreed. And so
much for this time.

Being tender of so great an engagement by solemn
covenant,—sincerely, really, and constantly to
endeavour in our places and callings, the preservation
of the reformed religion in this kirk of Scotland,
in doctrine, worship, discipline, and government,
the reformation of religion in the kingdoms
of England and Ireland, in doctrine, worship, discipline,
and government, according to the word of
God and the example of the best reformed kirks,
and to endeavour the nearest conjunction and
uniformity in all these, together with the extirpation
of heresy, schism, and whatsoever shall be
found contrary to sound doctrine: and considering,
withal, that one of the special means which it
becometh us in our places and callings to use in
pursuance of these ends is, in zeal for the true reformed
religion, to give our public testimony against
the dangerous tenets of Erastianism, Independency,
and (which is falsely called) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liberty of Conscience</span></span>,
which are not only contrary to sound doctrine, but
more special lets and hinderances as well to the
preservation of our own received doctrine, worship,
discipline and government, as to the work of reformation
and uniformity in England and Ireland.
The General Assembly upon these considerations,
having heard publicly read the one hundred and
eleven following propositions, exhibited and tendered
by some brethren who were appointed to prepare
articles or propositions for the vindication of
the truth in those particulars, doth unanimously
approve and agree unto these eight general heads
of doctrine therein contained and asserted, viz, 1.
That the ministry of the word and the administration
of the sacraments of the New Testament, baptism
and the Lord's supper, are standing ordinances,
instituted by God himself, to continue in the church
to the end of the world; 2. That such as administer
the word and sacraments ought to be duly called
and ordained thereunto; 3. That some ecclesiastical
censures are proper and peculiar to be inflicted
only upon such as bear office in the kirk; other
censures are common, and may be inflicted both on
ministers and other members of the kirk; 4. That
the censure of suspension from the sacrament of
the Lord's supper, inflicted because of gross ignorance,
or because of a scandalous life and conversation,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-003">[pg 5-003]</span><a name="Pg5-003" id="Pg5-003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as likewise the censure of excommunication or
casting out of the kirk flagitious or contumacious
offenders, both the one censure and the other is
warrantable by and grounded upon the word of
God, and is necessary (in respect of divine institution)
to be in the kirk; 5. That as the rights, power,
and authority of the civil magistrate are to be maintained
according to the word of God, and the confessions
of the faith of the reformed kirks, so it is
no less true and certain, that Jesus Christ, the only
Head and only King of the kirk, hath instituted and
appointed a kirk government, distinct from the civil
government or magistracy; 6. That the ecclesiastical
government is committed and entrusted by
Christ to the assemblies of the kirk, made up of the
ministers of the word and ruling elders; 7. That the
lesser and inferior ecclesiastical assemblies ought to
be subordinate and subject unto the greater and superior
assemblies; 8. That notwithstanding hereof,
the civil magistrate may and ought to suppress, by
corporal or civil punishments, such as by spreading
error or heresy, or by fomenting schism, greatly
dishonour God, dangerously hurt religion, and disturb
the peace of the kirk. Which heads of doctrine
(howsoever opposed by the authors and fomenters
of the foresaid errors respectively) the General Assembly
doth firmly believe, own, maintain, and commend
unto others, as solid, true, orthodox, grounded
upon the word of God, consonant to the judgment
both of the ancient and the best reformed kirks.
And because this Assembly (through the multitude
of other necessary and pressing business) cannot
now have so much leisure as to examine and consider
particularly the foresaid one hundred and
eleven propositions; therefore a more particular
examination thereof is committed and referred to
the theological faculties in the four universities of
this kingdom, and the judgment of each of these
faculties concerning the same is appointed to be reported
to the next General Assembly. In the mean
while these propositions shall be printed, both that
copies thereof may be sent to presbyteries, and that
it may be free for any that pleaseth to peruse them,
and to make known or send their judgment concerning
the same to the said next Assembly.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. As our Lord Jesus Christ doth invisibly
teach and govern his church by the
Holy Spirit; so in gathering, preserving,
instructing, building and saving thereof, he
useth ministers as his instruments, and hath
appointed an order of some to teach and
others to learn in the church, and that some
should be the flock and others the pastors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. For beside these first founders of the
church of Christ, extraordinarily sent, and
furnished with the gift of miracles, whereby
they might confirm the doctrine of the
gospel, he appointed also ordinary pastors
and teachers, for the executing of the ministry,
even until his coming again unto judgment,
Eph. iv. 11-13. Wherefore also, as
many as are of the number of God's people,
or will be accounted Christians, ought to receive
and obey the ordinary ministers of
God's word and sacraments (lawfully though
mediately called), as the stewards and ambassadors
of Christ himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. It is not lawful for any man, how fit
soever and how much soever enriched or
beautified with excellent gifts, to undertake
the administration either of the word or sacraments
by the will of private persons, or
others who have not power and right to call,
much less it is lawful by their own judgment
or arbitrement to assume and arrogate
the same to themselves. But before it be
lawful to undergo that sacred ministry in
churches constituted, a special calling, yea
beside, a lawful election (which alone is not
sufficient), a mission or sending, or (as commonly
it is termed) ordination, is necessarily
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-005">[pg 5-005]</span><a name="Pg5-005" id="Pg5-005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
required, and that both for the avoiding of
confusion, and to bar out or shut the door
(so far as in us lieth) upon impostors; as also
by reason of divine institution delivered to
us in the Holy Scripture, Rom. x. 15; Heb.
v. 4; Tit. i. 5; 1 Tim. ii. 7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The church ought to be governed by
no other persons than ministers and stewards
preferred and placed by Christ, and
after no other manner than according to the
laws made by him; and, therefore, there is
no power on earth which may challenge to
itself authority or dominion over the church:
but whosoever they are that would have the
things of Christ to be administered not according
to the ordinance and will of Christ
revealed in his word, but as it liketh them,
and according to their own will and prescript,
what other thing go they about to do
than by horrible sacrilege to throw down
Christ from his own throne?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. For our only lawgiver and interpreter
of his Father's will, Jesus Christ hath prescribed
and foreappointed the rule according
to which he would have his worship and the
government of his own house to be ordered.
To wrest this rule of Christ, laid open in his
holy word, to the counsels, wills, manners,
devices, or laws of men, is most high impiety.
But contrarily, the law of faith commandeth
the counsel and purposes of men to
be framed and conformed to this rule, and
overturneth all the reasonings of worldly
wisdom, and bringeth into captivity the
thoughts of the proud swelling mind to the
obedience of Christ. Neither ought the voice
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-006">[pg 5-006]</span><a name="Pg5-006" id="Pg5-006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of any to take place or be rested upon in the
church but the voice of Christ alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The same Lord and our Saviour Jesus
Christ, the only Head of the church, hath
ordained in the New Testament, not only
the preaching of the word and administration
of baptism and the Lord's supper, but
also ecclesiastical government, distinct and
differing from the civil government; and it
is his will that there be such a government
distinct from the civil in all his churches
everywhere, as well those which live under
Christian, as those under infidel magistrates,
even until the end of the world. Heb. xiii.
7, 17; 1 Tim. v. 17, 19; Rom. xii. 8; 1
Cor. xii. 28; 1 Thess. v. 12; Acts i. 20;
Luke xii. 42; 1 Tim. vi. 14; Rev. ii. 25.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. This ecclesiastical government, distinct
from the civil, is from God committed, not
to the whole body of the church or congregation
of the faithful, or to be exercised both
by officers and people, but to the ministers
of God's word, together with the elders
which are joined with them for the care and
government of the church, 1 Tim. v. 17. To
those, therefore, who are over the church in
the Lord, belongeth the authority and power,
and it lieth upon them by their office, according
to the rule of God's word, to discern
and judge betwixt the holy and profane,
to give diligence for amendment of
delinquents, and to purge the church (as
much as is in them) from scandals, and that
not only by inquiring, inspection, warning,
reproving, and more sharply expostulating,
but also by acting in the further and more
severe parts of ecclesiastical discipline, or exercising
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, even unto
the greatest and weightiest censures, where
deed is.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. None that is within the church ought
to be without the reach of church law, and
exempt from ecclesiastical censures; but discipline
is to be exercised on all the members
of the church, without respect or consideration
of those adhering qualities which
use to commend a man to other men, such
as power, nobility, illustrious descent, and
the like: for the judgment cannot be right
where men are led and moved with these
considerations. Wherefore, let respect of
persons be far from all judges, chiefly the
ecclesiastical: and if any in the church do so
swell in pride, that he refuse to be under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-007">[pg 5-007]</span><a name="Pg5-007" id="Pg5-007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this discipline, and would have himself to be
free and exempt from all trial and ecclesiastical
judgment, this man's disposition is
more like the haughtiness of the Roman
Pope, than the meekness and submissiveness
of Christ's sheep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Ecclesiastical censure, moreover, is
either proper to be inflicted upon the ministers
and office-bearers only, or with them
common to other members of the church:
the former consisteth in suspension or deposition
of ministers from their office (which
in the ancient canons is called καθαίρεσις);
the latter consisteth in the greater and lesser
excommunication (as they speak). Whatsoever
in another brother deserveth excommunication,
the same much more in a minister
deserveth excommunication: but justly
sometimes a minister is to be put from his
office, and deprived of that power which by
ordination was given him, against whom,
nevertheless, to draw the sword of excommunication,
no reason doth compel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. Sometime also it happeneth that a
minister, having fallen into heresy or apostacy,
or other grievous crimes, if he show
tokens of true repentance, may be justly received
into the communion of the church,
whom, notwithstanding, it is no way expedient
to restore into his former place or
charge; yea, perhaps it will not be found fit
to restore such an one to the ministry in another
congregation as soon as he is received
into the bosom of the church; which surely
is most agreeable as well to the word of
God (2 Kings xxiii. 9; Ezek. xliv. 10-14,)
as to that ecclesiastical discipline, which in
some ages after the times of the Apostle was
in use.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So true is it that the ministers of the
church are liable as well to peculiar as to
common censures; or that a minister of the
church is censured one way, and one of the
people another way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. Ecclesiastical censure, which is not
proper to ministers, but common to them
with other members of the church, is
either suspension from the Lord's supper
(which by others is called the publican's
excommunication), or the cutting off of a
member, which is commonly called excommunication.
The distinction of this twofold
censure (commonly, though not so properly
passing under the name of the lesser and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-008">[pg 5-008]</span><a name="Pg5-008" id="Pg5-008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
greater excommunication) is not only much
approved by the church of Scotland, and
the synod now assembled at Westminster,
but also by the reformed churches of France,
the Low Countries, and of Poland, as is to
be seen in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of the Ecclesiastical
Discipline of the Reformed Churches in
France</span></span>, chap. 5, art. 9; in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harmony
of the Belgic Synods</span></span>, chap. 14, art. 8, 9;
in the canons of the general synod of Torn,
held in the year 1597.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. That the distinction of that twofold
church censure was allowed also by antiquity,
it may be sufficiently clear to him who will
consult the sixty-first canon of the sixth
general synod, with the annotations of Zonaras
and Balsamon; also the thirteenth canon
of the eighth synod (which is termed
the first and second), with the notes of Zonaras;
yea, besides, even the penitents also
themselves of the fourth degree, or οἱ ἐν
συστασεῖ, that is, which were in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">consistency</span></span>,
were suspended from the Lord's supper,
though as to other things of the same
condition with the faithful; for, to the communion
also of prayers, and so to all privileges
of ecclesiastical society, the eucharist
alone excepted, they were thought to have
right: so sacred a thing was the eucharist
esteemed. See also, beside others, Cyprian,
book 1, epist. 11; that Dionysius, the author
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy</span></span>, chap.
3, part. 3; Basil., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist. to Amphilochius</span></span>,
can. 4; Ambrose, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Officiis</span></span>, lib. 2, chap.
27; Augustine, in his book against the
Donatists after the Conference, cap. 4;
Chrysostom, hom. 83, in Matt.; Gregor.
the Great, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist.</span></span>, lib. 2, chap. 65, 66;

chap. 17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
13. That first and lesser censure by
Christ's ordinance is to be inflicted on such
as have received baptism, and pretend to be
true members of the church, yet are found
unfit and unworthy to communicate in the
signs of the grace of Christ with the church,
whether for their gross ignorance of divine
things, the law, namely, and gospel, or by
reason of scandal, either of false doctrine or
wicked life. For these causes, therefore, or
for some one of them, they are to be kept
back from the sacrament of the Lord's supper
(a lawful judicial trial going before) according
to the interdiction of Christ, forbidding
that that which is holy be given to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-009">[pg 5-009]</span><a name="Pg5-009" id="Pg5-009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dogs, or pearls be cast before swine, Matt.
vii. 6; and this censure of suspension is to
continue till the offenders bring forth fruits
worthy of repentance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
14. For the asserting and defending of
this suspension there is no small accession of
strength from the nature of the sacrament
itself, and the institution and end thereof.
The word of God indeed is to be preached,
as well to the ungodly and impenitent, that
they may be converted, as to the godly and
repenting that they may be confirmed; but
the sacrament of the Lord's supper is by
God instituted, not for beginning the work
of grace, but for nourishing and increasing
grace, and therefore no one is to be admitted
to the Lord's supper who by his life testifieth
that he is impenitent, and not as yet
converted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
15. Indeed, if the Lord had instituted
this sacrament, that not only it should nourish
and cherish faith, and seal the promises
of the gospel, but also should begin the work
of grace in sinners, and give regeneration itself
as the instrumental cause thereof, verily
even the most wicked, most unclean, and
most unworthy, were to be admitted: but
the reformed churches do otherwise judge of
the nature of this sacrament, which shall be
abundantly manifest by the gleaning of
these following testimonies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
16. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scottish Confession</span></span>, art. 23.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But we confess that the Lord's supper belongs
only to those of the household of faith
who can try and examine themselves, as
well in faith as in the duties of faith towards
their neighbours. Whoso abideth without
faith, and in variance with their brethren,
do at that holy table eat and drink unworthily.
Hence it is that the pastors in our
church do enter on a public and particular
examination, both of the knowledge, conversation
and life, of those who are to be admitted
to the Lord's table.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Belgic
Confession</span></span>, art. 35:—<span class="tei tei-q">“We believe also and
confess that our Lord Jesus Christ hath
ordained the holy sacrament of his supper,
that in it he may nourish and uphold them
whom he hath already regenerated.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
17. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saxon Confession</span></span>, art. 15:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
Lord willeth that every receiver be
particularly confirmed by this testimony, so
that he may be certified that the benefits of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-010">[pg 5-010]</span><a name="Pg5-010" id="Pg5-010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the gospel do appertain to himself, seeing
the preaching is common, and by this testimony,
by this receiving, he showeth that
thou art one of his members, and washed
with his blood.”</span> And by and by:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Thus,
therefore, we instruct the church, that it
behoveth them that come to the supper to
bring with them repentance or conversion,
and (faith being now kindled in the mediation
of the death and resurrection, and the
benefits of the Son of God) to seek here the
confirmation of this faith.”</span> The very same
things are set down, and that in the very
same words, in the consent of the churches
of Poland in the Sendomirian synod, anno
1570, art. <span class="tei tei-q">“of the Lord's supper.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
18. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bohemian Confession</span></span>, art. 11:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Next
our divines teach that the sacraments
of themselves, or as some say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ex
opere operato</span></span>, do not confer grace to those
who are not first endued with good motions,
and inwardly quickened by the Holy Spirit,
neither do they bestow justifying faith,
which maketh the soul of man in all things
obsequious, trusting and obedient to God;
for faith must go before (we speak of them
of ripe years), which quickeneth a man by
the work of the Holy Spirit, and putteth
good motions into the heart.”</span> And after:—<span class="tei tei-q">“But
if any come unworthily to the sacraments,
he is not made by them worthy or
clean, but doth only bring greater sin and
damnation on himself.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
19. Seeing, then, in the holy supper, that
is, in the receiving the sacramental elements
(which is here distinguished from the prayers
and exhortations accompanying that action),
the benefits of the gospel are not first received,
but for them being received are
thanks given; neither by partaking thereof
doth God bestow the very spiritual life, but
doth preserve, cherish and perfect that life;
and seeing the word of God is accounted in
the manner of letters patent, but sacraments
like seals, (as rightly the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Helvetian Confession</span></span>
saith, chap. 19), it plainly followeth
that those are to be kept back from the
Lord's supper, who by their fruits and
manners do prove themselves to be ungodly
or impenitent, and strangers or aliens from
all communion with Christ. Nor are the
promises of grace sealed to any other than
those to whom these promises do belong, for
otherwise the seal annexed should contradict
and gainsay the letters patent; and by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-011">[pg 5-011]</span><a name="Pg5-011" id="Pg5-011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
visible word those should be loosed and remitted,
who by the audible word are bound
and condemned: but this is such an absurdity,
as that if any would, yet he cannot
smooth or heal it with any plaster.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
20. But as known, impious, and unregenerate
persons, have no right to the holy
table, so also ungodly persons, by reason of
a grievous scandal, are justly for a time deprived
of it; for it is not lawful or allowable
that the comforts and promises which belong
only to such as believe and repent,
should be sealed unto known unclean persons,
and those who walk inordinately,
whether such as are not yet regenerate, or
such as are regenerate, but fallen, and not
yet restored or risen from their fall. The
same discipline plainly was shadowed forth
under the Old Testament, for none of God's
people, during their legal pollution, were
permitted to enter into the tabernacle, or to
have access to the solemn sacrifices and
society of the church; and much more were
wicked and notorious offenders debarred
from the temple, until, by an offering for
sin, together with a solemn confession thereof,
being cleansed, they were reconciled unto
God. Num. v. 6-8; Lev. v. 1-7;
vi. 1-8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
21. Yea that those who were polluted
with sins and crimes were reckoned among
the unclean in the law, Maimonides (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in
More Nevoch.</span></span>, part. 3, ch. 47,) proveth out
of Lev. xx. 3; xviii. 24; Num. xxxv. 33,
34. Therefore seeing the shedding of man's
blood was rightly esteemed the greatest
pollution of all, hence it was that as the
society of the leprous was shunned by the
clean, so that the company of murderers by
good men was most religiously avoided,
Lam. iv. 13-15. The same thing is witnessed
by Ananias the high priest, in Josephus,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jewish War</span></span>, book 4, ch. 5, where
he saith that those false zealots of that
time, bloody men, ought to have been restrained
from access to the temple, by reason
of the pollution of murder; yea, as Philo
the Jew witnesseth (in his book of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Offerers of Sacrifices</span></span>), whosoever were
found unworthy and wicked, were by edict
forbidden to approach the holy threshold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
22. Neither must that be passed by which
was noted by Zonaras, book 4, of his annals
(whereof see also Scaliger agreeing with him,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-012">[pg 5-012]</span><a name="Pg5-012" id="Pg5-012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elench. Triheres. Nicserrar.</span></span>, cap.
28), namely, that the Essenes were forbidden
the holy place, as being heinous and
piacular transgressors, and such as held other
opinions, and did otherwise teach concerning
sacrifices than according to the law, and observed
not the ordinances of Moses, whence
it proceeded that they sacrificed privately;
yea, and also the Essenes themselves did
thrust away from their congregations those
that were wicked. Whereof see Drusius,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Of the Three Sects of Jews</span></span>, lib. 4, cap. 22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
23. God verily would not have his temple
to be made open to unworthy and unclean
worshippers; nor was it free for such
men to enter into the temple. See Nazianzen,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orat.</span></span> 21. The same thing is
witnessed and declared by divers late
writers, such as have been and are more acquainted
with the Jewish antiquities. Consult
the Annotations of Vatablus, and of
Ainsworth, an English writer, upon Psal.
cxviii. 19, 20; also Constantine L'Empereur,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Annot. in Cod. Middoth</span></span>, cap. 2, p.
44, 45; Cornelius Bertramus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Of the Commonwealth
of the Hebrews</span></span>, cap. 7; Henry
Vorstius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Animadvers. in Pirk. Rab.
Eliezer</span></span>, p. 169. The same may be proved
out of Ezek. xxiii. 30, 38; Jer. vii. 9-12;
whence also it was that the solemn and public
society in the temple, had the name of
the assembly of the righteous, and congregation
of saints, Psal. lxxxix. 5, 7; cxi. 1;
cxlvii. 1; hence also is that (Psal. cxviii. 19,
20) of the gates of righteousness by which
the righteous enter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
24. That which is now driven at, is not
that all wicked and unclean persons should
be utterly excluded from our ecclesiastical
societies, and so from all hearing of God's
word; yea there is nothing less intended:
for the word of God is the instrument as
well of conversion as of confirmation, and
therefore is to be preached as well to the
unconverted as to the converted, as well to
the repenting as the unrepenting: the temple
indeed of Jerusalem had special promises,
as it were pointing out with the finger
a communion with God through Christ, 1
Kings viii. 30, 48; Dan. vi. 10; 2 Chron.
vi. 16; vii. 15, 16. But it is far otherwise
with our temples, or places of church assemblies,
<span class="tei tei-q">“because our temples contain nothing
sacramental in them, such as the tabernacle
and temple contained,”</span> as the most learned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-013">[pg 5-013]</span><a name="Pg5-013" id="Pg5-013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Professors of Leyden said rightly in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Synops.
Pur. Theologiae</span></span>, disp. 48, thes. 47.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
25. Wherefore the point to be here considered,
as that which is now aimed at, is
this, that howsoever, even under the New
Testament, the uncleanness of those to whom
the word of God is preached be tolerated,
yet all such, of what estate or condition
soever in the church, as are defiled with
manifest and grievous scandals, and do thereby
witness themselves to be without the inward
and spiritual communion with Christ
and the faithful, may and are to be altogether
discharged from the communion of
the Lord's supper until they repent and
change their manners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
26. Besides, even those to whom it was
permitted to go into the holy courts of
Israel, and to ingratiate themselves into ecclesiastical
communion, and who did stand
between the court of Israel and the outer
wall, were not therefore to be kept back
from hearing the word; for in Solomon's
porch, and so in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">intermurale</span></span> or court
of the Gentiles, the gospel was preached,
both by Christ, John x. 23, and also by the
apostles, Acts iii. 11; v. 12, and that of
purpose, because of the reason brought by
Pineda, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Of the things of Solomon</span></span>, book
v. chap. 19, because a more frequent multitude
was there, and somewhat larger opportunity
of sowing the gospel: wherefore to
any whomsoever, even heathen people meeting
there, the Lord would have the word to
be preached, who, notwithstanding, purging
the temple, did not only overthrow the tables
of money-changers, and chairs of those
that sold doves, but also cast forth the
buyers and sellers themselves, Matt. xxi.
12; for he could not endure either such
things or such persons in the temple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
27. Although, then, the gospel is to be
preached to every creature, the Lord in express
words commanding the same, Mark
xvi. 15, yet not to every one is set open an
access to the holy supper; it is granted that
hypocrites do lurk in the church, who hardly
can be convicted and discovered, much less
repelled from the Lord's supper; such therefore
are to be suffered, till by the fan of
judgment the grain be separated from the
chaff; but those whose wicked deeds or
words are known and made manifest are altogether
to be debarred from partaking
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-014">[pg 5-014]</span><a name="Pg5-014" id="Pg5-014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those symbols of the covenant of the gospel,
lest that the name of God be greatly disgraced,
whilst sins are permitted to be spread
abroad in the church unpunished; or lest
the stewards of Christ, by imparting the
signs of the grace of God to such as are continuing
in the state of impurity and scandal,
be partakers of their sins. Hitherto of suspension.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
28. Excommunication ought not to be
proceeded unto except when extreme necessity
constraineth: but whensoever the
soul of the sinner cannot otherwise be healed,
and that the safety of the church requireth
the cutting off of this or that member,
it behoveth to use this last remedy.
In the church of Rome, indeed, excommunication
hath been turned into greatest injustice
and tyranny (as the Pharisees abused the
casting out of the synagogues, which was
their excommunication) to the fulfilling of
the lust of their own minds; yet the ordinance
of Christ is not therefore by any of
the reformed religion to be utterly thrust
away and wholly rejected. What Protestant
knows not that the vassals of Antichrist
have drawn the Lord's supper into the worst
and most pernicious abuses, as also the ordination
of ministers, and other ordinances of
the gospel? Yet who will say that things
necessary (whether the necessity be that of
command, or that of the means or end) are
to be taken away because of the abuse?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
29. They, therefore, who with an high
hand do persevere in their wickedness, after
foregoing admonitions stubbornly despised
or carelessly neglected, are justly, by excommunication
in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, cut off and cast out from the
society of the faithful, and are pronounced
to be cast out from the church, until being
filled with shame and cast down, they shall
return again to a more sound mind, and by
confession of their sin and amendment of
their lives, shall show tokens of repentance,
Matt, xviii. 16-18; 1 Cor. v. 13, which
places are also alleged in the Confession of
Bohemia, art. 8, to prove that the excommunication
of the impenitent and stubborn,
whose wickedness is known, is commanded
of the Lord: but if stubborn heretics or unclean
persons be not removed or cast out
from the church, therein do the governors
of the church sin, and are found guilty, Rev.
ii. 14, 20.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-015">[pg 5-015]</span><a name="Pg5-015" id="Pg5-015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

30. But that all abuse and corruption in
ecclesiastical government may be either prevented
and avoided, or taken away, or lest
the power of the church, either by the ignorance
or unskilfulness of some ministers here
and there, or also by too much heat and
fervour of mind, should run out beyond
measure or bounds, or contrariwise, being
shut up within straiter limits than is fitting,
should be made unprofitable, feeble, or of
none effect,—Christ, the most wise lawgiver
of his church, hath foreseen and made provision
to prevent all such evils which he did
foresee were to arise, and hath prepared and
prescribed for them intrinsical and ecclesiastical
remedies, and those also in their kind
(if lawfully and rightly applied) both sufficient
and effectual: some whereof he hath
most expressly propounded in his word, and
some he hath left to be drawn from thence
by necessary consequence.

31. Therefore, by reason of the danger of
that which is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">clavis errans</span></span>, or a
wrong key; and that it may not be permitted
to particular churches to err or sin
licentiously, and lest any man's cause be
overthrown and perish, who in a particular
church had perhaps the same men both his
adversaries and his judges; also that common
business, which do belong to many
churches, together with the more weighty
and difficult controversies (the deciding
whereof in the consistories of praticular
churches is not safe to be adventured upon)
may be handled and determined by a common
council of presbyteries; finally, that
the governors of particular churches may
impart help mutually one to another against
the cunning and subtile enemies of the truth,
and may join their strength together (such
as it is) by an holy combination, and that
the church may be as a camp of an army
well ordered, lest while every one striveth
singly all of them be subdued and overcome,
or lest by reason of the scarcity of prudent
and godly counsellors (in the multitude of
whom is safety) the affairs of the church
be undone: for all these considerations particular
churches must be subordinate to
classical presbyteries and synods.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
32. Wherefore it is not lawful to particular
churches, or, as commonly they are called,
parochial, either to decline the authority of
classes or synods, where they are lawfully
settled, or may be had (much less to withdraw
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-016">[pg 5-016]</span><a name="Pg5-016" id="Pg5-016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
themselves from that authority, if they
have once acknowledged it), or to refuse such
lawful ordinances or decrees of the classes
or synods as, being agreeable to the word
of God, are with authority imposed upon
them. Acts xv. 2, 6, 22-24, 28, 29; xvi. 4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
33. Although synods assemble more seldom,
classes and consistories of particular
churches more frequently, yet that synods,
both provincial and national, assemble at set
and ordinary times, as well as classes and parochial
consistories, is very expedient, and
for the due preservation of church policy and
discipline, necessary. Sometimes, indeed, it
is expedient they be assembled occasionally,
that the urgent necessity of the church may
be the more speedily provided for, namely,
when such a business happeneth, which,
without great danger, cannot be put off till
the appointed time of the synod.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
34. But that, besides occasional synods, ordinary
synods be kept at set times, is most
profitable, not only that they may discuss
and determine the more difficult ecclesiastical
causes coming before them, whether by
the appeal of some person aggrieved, or by
the hesitation or doubting of inferior assemblies
(for such businesses very often fall out),
but also that the state of the churches whereof
they have the care, being more certainly
and frequently searched and known, if there
be anything wanting or amiss in their doctrine,
discipline or manners, or anything worthy
of punishment, the slothful labourers in
the vineyard of the Lord may be made to
shake off the spirit of slumber and slothfulness,
and be stirred up to the attending and
fulfilling more diligently their calling, and
not suffered any longer to sleep and snore in
their office; the stragglers and wanderers
may be reduced to the way; the untoward
and stiff-necked, which scarce, or very hardly,
suffer the yoke of discipline, as also unquiet
persons, who devise new and hurtful
things, may be reduced to order: finally,
whatsoever doth hinder the more quick and
efficacious course of the gospel may be discovered
and removed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
35. It is too, too manifest (alas for it!)
that there are those who with unwearied
diligence, do most carefully labour that
they may oppress the liberties and rights of
synods, and may take away from them all
liberty of consulting of things and matters
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-017">[pg 5-017]</span><a name="Pg5-017" id="Pg5-017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ecclesiastical, at least of determining thereof
(for they well know how much the union
and harmony of churches may make against
their designs): but so much the more it concerneth
the orthodox churches to know, defend
and preserve, this excellent liberty
granted to them by divine right, and so to
use it, that imminent dangers, approaching
evils, urging grievances, scandals growing
up, schisms rising, heresies creeping in, errors
spreading, and strifes waxing hot, may
be corrected and taken away, to the glory of
God, and the edification and peace of the
church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
36. Beside provincial and national synods,
an œcumenical (so called from οἰκουμένη,
that is from the habitable world,) or more
truly, a general, or, if you will, an universal
synod, if so it lie free and rightly constituted,
and no other commissioners but orthodox
churches be admitted (for what communion
is there of light with darkness, of righteousness
with unrighteousness, or of the temple
of God with idols); such a synod is of special
utility, peradventure also such a synod
is to be hoped for, surely it is to be wished
that, for defending the orthodox faith, both
against Popery and other heresies, as also
for propagating it to those who are without,
especially the Jews, a more strait and more
firm consociation may be entered into. For
the unanimity of all the churches, as in evil
it is of all things most hurtful, so on the contrary
side, in good it is most pleasant, most
profitable, and most effectual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
37. Unto the universal synod also (when
it may be had) is to be referred the judgment
of controversies, not of all, but of those
which are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">controversiæ juris</span></span>, controversies
of right; neither yet of all these, but of the
chief and most weighty controversies of the
orthodox faith, or of the most hard and unusual
cases of conscience. Of the controversies
of fact there is another and different
consideration to be had; for besides that it
would be a great inconvenience that plaintives,
persons accused, and witnesses, be
drawn from the most remote churches to
the general or universal council, the visible
communion itself of all the churches (on
which the universal council is built, and
whereupon, as on a foundation, it leaneth)
is not so much of company, fellowship, or
conversation, as of religion and doctrine.
All true churches of the world do indeed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-018">[pg 5-018]</span><a name="Pg5-018" id="Pg5-018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
profess the same true religion and faith, but
there is beside this a certain commixture and
conjunction of the churches of the same nation,
as to a more near fellowship, and some
acquaintance, conversing and companying
together, which cannot be said of all the
churches throughout the habitable world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
38. And for this cause, as in doctrinal
controversies, which are handled by theologists
and casuists, and in those which belong
to the common state of the orthodox
churches, the national synod is subordinate
and subjected to the universal lawfully-constituted
synod, and from the national to the
oecumenical synod (when there is a just and
weighty cause) an appeal is open: so there is
no need that the appeals of those who complain
of injury done to them through the exercise
of discipline in this or that church,
should go beyond the bounds of the national
synod; but it is most agreeable to reason that
they should rest and acquiesce within those
bounds and borders; and that the ultimate
judgment of such mutters be in the national
synod, unless the thing itself be so hard and
of so great moment, that the knot be justly
thought worthy of a greater decider; in
which case the controversy which is carried
to the universal synod is rather of an abstract
general theological proposition than
of the particular or individual case.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
39. Furthermore, the administration of
the ecclesiastic power in consistories, classes
and synods, doth not at all tend to weaken
in anywise, hurt or diminish, the authority
of the civil magistrate, much less to take it
away or destroy it; yea, rather, by it a most
profitable help cometh to the magistrate,
forasmuch as by the bond of religion men's
consciences are more straitly tied unto him.
There has been, indeed, fantastical men,
who, under pretence and cloak of Christian
liberty, would abolish and cast out laws and
judgments, orders also, degrees and honours,
out of the commonwealth, and have been
bold to reckon the function of the magistrate
armed with the sword among evil things and
unlawful: but the reformed churches do renounce
and detest these dreams, and do most
harmoniously and most willingly confess and
acknowledge it to be God's will that the
world be governed by laws and policy, and
that he himself hath appointed the civil magistrate,
and hath delivered to him the sword
to the protection and praise of good men,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-019">[pg 5-019]</span><a name="Pg5-019" id="Pg5-019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but for punishment and revenge on the evil,
that by this bridle, men's vices and faults
may be restrained, whether these are committed
against the first or second table.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
40. The reformed churches believe also,
and openly confess, the power and authority
of emperors over their empires, of kings
over their kingdoms, of princes and dukes
over their dominions, and of other magistrates
or states over their commonwealths
and cities, to be the ordinances of God himself
appointed as well to the manifestation
of his own glory, as to the singular profit of
mankind: and withal, that by reason of the
will of God himself, revealed in his word, we
must not only suffer and be content that
those do rule which are set over their own
territories, whether by hereditary or by elective
right, but also to love them, fear them,
and with all reverence and honour embrace
them as the ambassadors and ministers of
the most high and good God, being in his
stead, and preferred for the good of their
subjects, to pour out prayers for them, to
pay tributes to them, and in all business of
the commonwealth which is not against the
word of God, to obey their laws and edicts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
41. The orthodox churches believe also,
and do willingly acknowledge, that every
lawful magistrate, being by God himself constituted
the keeper and defender of both
tables of the law, may and ought first and
chiefly to take care of God's glory, and (according
to his place, or in his manner and
way) to preserve religion when pure, and to
restore it when decayed and corrupted: and
also to provide a learned and godly ministry,
schools also and synods, as likewise to restrain
and punish as well atheists, blasphemers,
heretics and schismatics, as the violaters
of justice and civil peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
42. Wherefore the opinion of those sectaries
of this age is altogether to be disallowed,
who, though otherwise insinuating themselves
craftily into the magistrate's favour,
do deny unto him the authority and right of
restraining heretics and schismatics, and do
hold and maintain that such persons, how
much soever hurtful and pernicious enemies
to true religion and to the church, yet are
to be tolerated by the magistrate, if so be
he conceive them to be such as no way violate
the laws of the commonwealth, and in
nowise disturb the civil peace.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-020">[pg 5-020]</span><a name="Pg5-020" id="Pg5-020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
43. Yet the civil power and the ecclesiastical
ought not by any means to be confounded
or mixed together. Both powers
are indeed from God, and ordained for his
glory, and both to be guided by his word,
and both are comprehended under that precept,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Honour thy father and thy mother,”</span>
so that men ought to obey both civil magistrates
and ecclesiastical governors in the
Lord; to both powers their proper dignity
and authority is to be maintained and preserved
in force: to both also is some way intrusted
the keeping of both tables of the law,
also both the one and the other doth exercise
some jurisdiction, and giveth sentence
of judgment in an external court or judicatory:
but these and other things of like sort,
in which they agree notwithstanding, yet by
marvellous vast differences are they distinguished
the one from the other, and the
rights of both remain distinct, and that eight
manner of ways, which it shall not be amiss
here to add, that unto each of these administrations,
its own set bounds may be the
better maintained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
44. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, therefore, they are differenced
the one from the other, in respect of the very
foundation and the institution: for the political
or civil power is grounded upon the law of
nature itself, and for that cause it is common
to infidels with Christians; the power ecclesiastical
dependeth immediately upon the
positive law of Christ alone: that belongeth
to the universal dominion of God the Creator
over all nations; but this unto the special
and economical kingdom of Christ the
Mediator, which he exerciseth in the church
alone, and which is not of this world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
45. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></span> difference is in the
object, or matter about which: the power
politic or civil is occupied about the outward
man, and civil or earthly things,—about
war, peace, conservation of justice, and good
order in the commonwealth; also about the
outward business or external things of the
church, which are indeed necessary to the
church, or profitable, as touching the outward
man, yet not properly and purely spiritual,
for they do not reach unto the soul, but only
to the external state and condition of the
ministers and members of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
46. For the better understanding whereof
it is to be observed, that so far as the
ministers and members of the church are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-021">[pg 5-021]</span><a name="Pg5-021" id="Pg5-021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
citizens, subjects, or members of the commonwealth,
it is in the power of the magistrate
to judge, determine, and give sentence,
concerning the disposing of their bodies or
goods; as also concerning the maintenance
of the poor, the sick, the banished, and of
others in the church who are afflicted; to
regulate (so far as concerneth the civil order)
marriages, burials, and other circumstances
which are common both to holy, and
also to honest civil societies; to afford places
fit for holy assemblies, and other external
helps by which the sacred matters of the
Lord may be more safely, commodiously,
and more easily in the church performed,
to remove the external impediments of divine
worship or of ecclesiastical peace, and to
repress those who exalt themselves against
the true church and her ministers, and do
raise up trouble against them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
47. The matter may further be thus illustrated,
there is almost the like respect
and consideration of the magistrate as he is
occupied about the outward things of the
church, and of the ecclesiastic ministry as it
is occupied about the inward or spiritual
part of civil government, that is, about those
things which in the government of the commonwealth
belong to the conscience. It is
one thing to govern the commonwealth, and
to make political and civil laws, another
thing to interpret the word of God, and out
of it to show the magistrate his duty, to wit,
how he ought to govern the commonwealth,
and in what manner he ought to use the
sword. The former is proper and peculiar
to the magistrate (neither doth the ministry
intermeddle or entangle itself into such
businesses), but the latter is contained within
the office of the ministers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
48. For to that end also in the holy
Scripture profitable, to show which is the
best manner of governing a commonwealth,
and that the magistrate, as being God's
minister, may by this guiding star be so directed,
as that he may execute the parts of
his office according to the will of God, and
may perfectly be instructed to every good
work; yet the minister is not said properly
to treat of civil businesses, but of the scandals
which arise about them, or in the cases
of conscience which occur in the administration
of the commonwealth, so also the magistrate
is not properly said to be exercised
about the spiritual things of the church, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-022">[pg 5-022]</span><a name="Pg5-022" id="Pg5-022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rather about those external things which adhere
unto and accompany the spiritual things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
49. And in such external matters of the
church, although all magistrates will not,
yet all, yea even heathen magistrates, may
and ought to aid and help the church:
whence it is that by the command of God
prayers are to be made also for an heathen
magistrate, that the faithful under them
may live a quiet life, with all godliness and
honesty, 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
50. Unto the external things of the
church belongeth, not only the correction of
heretics and other troublers of the church,
but also that civil order and way of convocating
and calling together synods which is
proper to the magistrate; for the magistrate
ought by his authority and power both to
establish the rights and liberties of synods
assembling together at times appointed by
the known and received law, and to indict
and gather together synods occasionally, as
often as the necessity of the church shall require
the same. Not that all or any power
to consult or determine of ecclesiastic or spiritual
matters doth flow or spring from the
magistrate as head of the church under
Christ, but because in those things pertaining
to the outward man, the church needeth
the magistrate's aid and support.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
51. So that the magistrate calleth together
synods, not as touching those things
which are proper to synods, but in respect
of the things which are common to synods
with other meetings and civil public assemblies,
that is, not as they are assemblies in
the name of Christ, to treat of matters spiritual,
but as they are public assemblies
within his territories; for to the end that
public conventions may be kept in any territory,
the license of the lord of that place
ought to be desired. In synods, therefore,
a respect of order, as well civil as ecclesiastical,
is to be had; and because of this civil
order, outward defence, better accommodation,
together with safe access and recess,
the consent and commandment of him who
is appointed to take care of, and defend human
order, doth intervene.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
52. Moreover, when the church is rent
asunder by unhappy and lamentable schisms,
while they who have raised the troubles, and
given cause for the solemn gathering of a synod
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-023">[pg 5-023]</span><a name="Pg5-023" id="Pg5-023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(whether by their heresy, or schism, or
tyranny, or any other fault of others), use
to place the great strength and safeguard of
their cause in declining and fleeing the trial
and sentence of a free synod as being formidable
to them, who seeth not that they cannot
be drawn to a public and judicial trial,
nor other disobedient persons be compelled
to obedience, without the magistrate's public
mandate and help.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
53. The object of ecclesiastical power is
not the same with the object of the civil
power, but much differing from it; for the
ecclesiastical power doth determine and appoint
nothing concerning men's bodies,
goods, dignities, civil rights, but is employed
only about the inward man or the soul;
not that it can search the hearts or judge
of the secrets of the conscience, which is in
the power of God alone: yet notwithstanding
it hath for its proper object those externals
which are purely spiritual, and do belong
properly and most nearly to the spiritual good
of the soul; which also are termed τὰ εἴσα τῆς
ἐκκλησίας, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the inward things of the church</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
54. Those things, then, wherein the ecclesiastical
power is exercised, are the preaching
of the word, the administration of sacraments,
public prayer and thanksgiving, the
catechising and instructing of children and
ignorant persons, the examination of those
who are to come to the holy communion,
the ecclesiastical discipline, the ordination of
ministers, and the abdication, deposing, and
degrading of them (if they become like unsavoury
salt), the deciding and determining
of controversies of faith and cases of conscience,
canonical constitutions concerning
the treasury of the church and collections of
the faithful, as also concerning ecclesiastical
rites or indifferent things which pertain to
the keeping of decency and order in the
church, according to the general rules of
Christian love and prudence contained in
the word of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
55. It is true that about the same things
the civil power is occupied, as touching the
outward man, or the outward disposing of
divine things in this or that dominion, as
was said, not as they are spiritual and evangelical
ordinances piercing into the conscience
itself, but the object of the power
ecclesiastical is a thing merely and purely
spiritual; and in so far as it is spiritual (for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-024">[pg 5-024]</span><a name="Pg5-024" id="Pg5-024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even that jurisdiction ecclesiastical which is
exercised in an outward court or judicatory,
and which inflicteth public censures, forbiddeth
from the use of the holy supper, and
excludeth from the society of the church)
doth properly concern the inward man, or
the repentance and salvation of the soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
56. Surely the faithful and godly ministers,
although they could do it unchallenged
and uncontrolled, and were therein allowed
by the magistrate (as in the prelatical times
it was) yet would not usurp the power of
life and death, or judge and determine concerning
men's honours, goods, inheritance,
division of families, or other civil businesses,
seeing they well know these things to be
heterogeneous to their office; but as they
ought not to entangle themselves with the
judging of civil causes, so if they should be
negligent and slothful in their own office,
they shall in that be no less culpable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
57. To the object also of ecclesiastical
power belongeth the assembling of synods, so
far as they are spiritual assemblies proper to
the church, and assembled in the Holy
Ghost; for being so considered, the governors
of churches, after the example of the
apostles and presbyters, Acts xv., in a manifest
danger of the church, ought to use their
own right of meeting together and convening,
that the churches endangered may be
relieved and supported.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
58. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thirdly</span></span>, These powers are differenced
in respect of their forms, and that
three ways: for, first, the civil power, although
in respect of God it be ministerial,
yet in respect of the subjects it is lordly and
magisterial. Ecclesiastical power is indeed
furnished with authority, yet that authority
is liker the fatherly than the kingly authority;
yea also it is purely ministerial, much
less can it be lawful to ministers of the church
to bear dominion over the flock.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
59. Emperors, kings, and other magistrates
are indeed appointed fathers of the
country, but they are withal lords of their
people and subjects: not as if it were permitted
to them to bear rule and command
at their own will and as they list (for they
are the ministers of God for the good and
profit of the subjects), yet it belongs to their
power truly and properly to exercise dominion,
to hold principality, to proceed imperiously.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-025">[pg 5-025]</span><a name="Pg5-025" id="Pg5-025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is indeed the duty of ministers
and rulers of the church to oversee, to
feed as shepherds, to correct and rectify, to
bear the keys, to be stewards in the house
of Christ, but in nowise to be lords over
the house, or to govern as lords, or lord-like
to rule; yea, in brief, this is the difference
between the civil magistrate and the ecclesiastical
ministry, in respect of those who
are committed to their trust, that the lot of
the former is to be served or ministered unto,
the lot of the latter to minister or serve.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
60. Now we have one only Lord who
governs our souls, neither is it competent to
man, but to God alone, to have power and
authority over consciences. But the Lord
hath appointed his own stewards over his
own family, that according to his commandment
they may give to every one their allowance
or portion, and to dispense his mysteries
faithfully; and to them he hath delivered
the keys, or power of letting into
his house, or excluding out of his house
those whom he himself will have let in or
shut out. Matt. xvi. 19; and xviii. 18;
Luke xii. 42; 1 Cor. iv. 1; Tit. i. 7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
61. Next, the civil power is endued with
authority of compelling; but it belongs not
to the ministry to compel the disobedient.
If any compulsion be in or about ecclesiastical
matters, it is adventitious from without,
to wit, from the help and assistance of the
magistrate, not from the nature of ecclesiastical
power, from which it is very heterogeneous;
and, therefore, if any suspended or
excommunicate person should be found who
shall be so stiff-necked, and so impudent,
that at once he cast off all shame, and make
no account at all of those censures, but scorn
and contemn the same, or peradventure shall
insolently or proudly obtrude himself upon
the sacrament, or being also filled with devilish
malice do more and more contradict and
blaspheme, the ecclesiastical ministry in such
cases hath nothing more to do by way of
jurisdiction: but the magistrate hath in
readiness a compelling jurisdiction and external
force, whereby such stubborn, rebellious,
and undaunted pride may be externally
repressed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
62. Last of all, the power of the magistrate
worketh only politically or civilly, according
to the nature of the sceptre or sword,
maketh and guardeth civil laws, which sometimes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-026">[pg 5-026]</span><a name="Pg5-026" id="Pg5-026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also he changeth or repealeth, and
other things of that kind he effecteth with
a secular power: but the ecclesiastical power
dealeth spiritually, and only in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by authority
intrusted or received from him alone: neither
is exercised without prayer or calling
on the name of God; nor, lastly, doth it use
any other than spiritual weapons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
63. The same sin, therefore, in the same
man may be punished one way by the civil,
another way by the ecclesiastical power; by
the civil power under the formality of a
crime, with corporal or pecuniary punishment,
by the ecclesiastical power, under the
notion and nature of scandal, with a spiritual
censure, even as also the same civil question
is one way deliberate upon and handled
by the magistrate in the senate or place of
judgment, another way by the minister of
the church, in the presbytery or synod; by
the magistrate, so far as it pertaineth to the
government of the commonwealth, by the
minister, as far as it respects the conscience;
for the ecclesiastical ministry also
is exercised about civil things spiritually, in
so far as it teacheth and admonisheth the
magistrate out of the word of God what is
best and most acceptable unto God; or as
it reproveth freely unjust judgments, unjust
wars, and the like, and out of the Scripture
threateneth the wrath of God to be revealed
against all unrighteousness of men: so
also is the magistrate said to be occupied
civilly about spiritual things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
64. Therefore all the actions of the civil
magistrate, even when he is employed about
ecclesiastical matters, are of their own nature
and essentially civil, he punisheth externally
idolaters, blasphemers, sacrilegious
persons, heretics, profaners of holy things,
and according to the nature and measure of
the sin he condemneth to death or banishment,
forfeiture of goods, or imprisonment;
he guardeth and underproppeth ecclesiastical
canons with civil authority, giveth a place of
habitation to the church in his territory, restraineth
or expelleth the insolent and untamed
disturbers of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
65. He taketh care also for maintaining
the ministers and schools, and supplieth the
temporal necessities of God's servants; by his
command assembleth synods, when there is
need of them; and summoneth, calleth out,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-027">[pg 5-027]</span><a name="Pg5-027" id="Pg5-027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and draws to trial the unwilling, which
without the magistrate's strength and authority
cannot be done, as hath been already
said; he maketh synods also safe and secure,
and in a civil way presideth or moderateth
in them (if it seem so good to him) either by
himself or by a substitute commissioner: in
all which the power of the magistrate, though
occupied about spiritual things, is not for all
that spiritual, but civil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
66. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourthly</span></span>, They differ in the end. The
immediate nearest end of civil power is, that
the good of the commonwealth may be provided
for and procured, whether it be, in
time of peace, according to the rules of law
and counsel of judges, or in time of war, according
to the rules of military prudence,
and so the temporal safety of the subjects
may be procured, and that external peace
and civil liberty may be preserved, and, being
lost, may be again restored.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
67. But the chiefest and last end of civil
government is, the glory of God the Creator,
namely, that those who do evil, being by a
superior power restrained or punished, and
those who do good getting praise of the
same, the subjects so much the more may
shun impiety and injustice, and that virtue,
justice, and the moral law of God (as touching
those eternal duties of both tables, unto
which all the posterity of Adam are obliged)
may remain in strength and flourish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
68. But whereas the Christian magistrate
doth wholly devote himself to the promoting
of the gospel and kingdom of Christ, and
doth direct and bend all the might and
strength of his authority to that end: this
proceedeth not from the nature of his office
or function, which is common to him with
an infidel magistrate, but from the influence
of his common Christian calling into
his particular vocation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
69. For every member of the church (and
so also the faithful and godly magistrate)
ought to refer and order his particular vocation,
faculty, ability, power and honour, to
this end, that the kingdom of Christ may be
propagated and promoted, and the true religion
be cherished and defended: so that
the advancement of the gospel, and of all
the ordinances of the gospel, is indeed the
end of the godly magistrate, not of a magistrate
simply: or (if ye will rather) it is not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-028">[pg 5-028]</span><a name="Pg5-028" id="Pg5-028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the end of the office itself, but of him who
doth execute the same piously.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
70. But the end of ecclesiastical power,
yea, the end as well of the ministry itself as
of the godly minister, is, that the kingdom
of Christ may be set forward; that the
paths of the Lord be made straight; that
his holy mysteries may be kept pure; that
stumblingblocks may be removed out of the
church, lest a little leaven leaven the whole
lump, or lest one sick or scabbed sheep infect
the whole flock; that the faithful may
so walk as it becometh the gospel of Christ,
and that the wandering sheep of Christ
may be converted and brought back to the
sheepfold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
71. And seeing this power is given of
the Lord not to destruction but to edification,
therefore this same scope is propounded
in excommunication (which is the greatest
and last of ecclesiastical censures), namely,
that the soul of an offending brother
may be gained to Christ, and that, being
stricken with fear, and the stubborn sinner
filled with shame, may by the grace of
God be humbled, and may (as a brand
plucked out of the fire) be snatched out of
the snare of the devil, and may repent unto
salvation; at least the rest may turn away
from those which are branded with such a
censure, lest the soul-infection do creep and
spread further.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
72. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fifthly</span></span>, They are distinguished by
the effect. The effect of civil power is
either proper, or by way of redundance.
The proper effect is the safety temporal of
the commonwealth, external tranquillity, the
fruition of civil liberty, and of all things which
are necessary to the civil society of men:
the effect by way of redundance is the good
of the church, to wit, in so far as, by execution
of justice and good laws, some impediments
that usually hinder and disturb the course
of the gospel, are avoided or taken away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
73. For by how much the more faithfully
the magistrate executeth his office in punishing
the wicked, and cherishing and encouraging
good men, taking away those things
which withstand the gospel, and punishing
or driving away the troublers and subverters
of the church,—so much the more the
orthodox faith and godliness are reverenced
and had in estimation,—sins are hated and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-029">[pg 5-029]</span><a name="Pg5-029" id="Pg5-029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
feared. Finally, All the subjects contained
(as much as concerneth the outward man)
within the lists of God's law, whence, also,
by consequence, it happeneth, by God's
blessing, that the church is defiled with
fewer scandals, and doth obtain the more
freedom and peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
74. But the proper effect of the ecclesiastical
power, or keys of the kingdom
of heaven is wholly spiritual; for the
act of binding and loosing, of retaining
and remitting sins, doth reach to the soul
and conscience itself (which cannot be said
of the act of the civil power): and as unjust
excommunication is void, so ecclesiastical
censure, being inflicted by the ministers
of Christ and his stewards according to his
will, is ratified in heaven (Matt, xviii. 18),
and therefore ought to be esteemed and acknowledged
in like manner as inflicted by
Christ himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
75. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sixthly</span></span>, They are also differenced in
respect of the subjects. The politic power
is committed sometimes to one, sometimes to
more, sometime by right of election, sometime
by right of succession; but the ecclesiastical
power is competent to none under the
New Testament by the right of succession, but
he who hath it must be called by God and the
church to it; neither was it given by Christ
to one, either pastor or elder, much less to a
prelate, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the church</span></em>, that is, to the
consistory of presbyters. It is confessed,
indeed, and who can be ignorant of it, that
the power, as they call it, of order, doth belong
to particular ministers, and is by each
of them apart lawfully exercised. But that
power which is commonly called of jurisdiction
is committed not to one, but to the
unity, that is, to a consistory; therefore ecclesiastical
censure ought not to be inflicted
but <span class="tei tei-q">“by many,”</span> 2 Cor. ii. 6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
76. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seventhly</span></span>, They differ as touching
the correlative. God hath commanded, that
unto the civil power every soul, or all members
of the commonwealth, of what condition
and estate soever, be subject; for what
have we to do with the Papists, who will
have them whom they call the clergy or
ecclesiastical persons, to be free from the
yoke of the civil magistrate? The ecclesiastical
power extends itself to none other
subjects than unto those which are called
brethren, or members of the church.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-030">[pg 5-030]</span><a name="Pg5-030" id="Pg5-030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
77. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eighthly</span></span>, There remaineth another
difference in respect of the distinct and divided
exercise of authority, for either power
ceasing from its duty, or remitting punishment,
that doth not (surely it ought not)
prejudice the exercise of the other power,
namely, if the magistrate cease to do his
duty, or do neglect to punish, with secular
punishment, those malefactors who, by profession,
are church members nevertheless,
it is in the power of the governors of the
church, by the bridle of ecclesiastical discipline,
to curb such men; yea also, by virtue
of their office, they are bound to do it, and
on the other part, the magistrate may and
ought to punish in life and limb, honours or
goods, notwithstanding of the offender's repentance
or reconciliation with the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
78. Therefore, the one sword being put
up in the scabbard, it is free, and often necessary,
to draw the other. Neither power
is bound to cast out or receive him whom
the other doth cast forth or receive the reason
whereof is, because the ecclesiastical
ministry doth chiefly respect the repentance
to salvation, and gaining of the sinner's
soul, wherefore it also embraceth all kinds
of wicked men repenting, and receiveth
them into the bosom of the church; the
magistrate proposeth to himself another and
much differing scope, for even repenting
offenders are by him punished, both that
justice and the laws may be satisfied, as
also to terrify others,—hence it is that absolution
from ecclesiastic censure freeth not
at all the delinquent from civil judgment
and the external sword.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
79. Seeing, then, there are so many and
so great differences of both offices, and seeing
also that the function of ministers and
elders of the church is not at all contained
in the office of the magistrate, neither, on
the other part, is this comprehended within
that, magistrates shall no less sin in usurping
ecclesiastical power, ministering holy
things, ordaining ministers, or exercising discipline
ecclesiastical, than ministers should
sin in rushing into the borders of the magistrate,
and in thrusting themselves into his
calling.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
80. Neither are those powers more mingled
one with another, or less distinguished,
where the magistrate is a Christian than
where he is an infidel, for as in a believing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-031">[pg 5-031]</span><a name="Pg5-031" id="Pg5-031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
father, and in an infidel father, the rights of
a father are the same, so in a Christian magistrate,
and in an infidel magistrate, the
rights of magistrates are the same; so that
to the magistrate converted to the Christian
faith there is no accession of new right,
or increase of civil power, although being
endued with true faith and piety, he is made
more fit and willing to the undergoing of
his office and the doing of his duty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
81. So, then, the word of God and the
law of Christ, which by so evident difference
separateth and distinguisheth ecclesiastical
government from the civil, forbiddeth
the Christian magistrate to enter upon or
usurp the ministry of the word and sacraments,
or the judicial dispensing of the keys
of the kingdom of heaven, to invade the
church government, or to challenge to himself
the right of both swords, spiritual and
corporal; but if any magistrate (which God
forbid) should dare to arrogate to himself
so much, and to enlarge his skirts so far, the
church shall then straightway be constrained
to complain justly, and cry out, that though
the Pope is changed, yet popedom remaineth
still.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
82. It is unlawful, moreover, to a Christian
magistrate to withstand the practice
and execution of ecclesiastical discipline
(whether it be that which belongs to a particular
church, or the matter be carried to
a class or synod). Now the magistrate withstandeth
the ecclesiastic discipline, either by
prohibitions and unjust laws, or, by his evil
example, stirring up and inciting others to
the contempt thereof, or to the trampling
it under foot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
83. Surely the Christian magistrate (if
at any time he give any grievous scandal to
the church), seeing he also is a member of
the church, ought nowise disdain to submit
himself to the power of the keys; neither is
this to be marvelled at, for even as the office
of the minister of the church is nowise
subordinate and subjected to the civil power,
but the person of the minister, as he is a
member of the commonwealth, is subject
thereto, so the civil power itself, or the magistrate,
as a magistrate, is not subjected to
ecclesiastical power; yet that man, who is a
magistrate, ought (as he is a member of the
church) to be under the church's censure of
his manners, after the example of the emperor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-032">[pg 5-032]</span><a name="Pg5-032" id="Pg5-032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Theodosius, unless he will despise and
set at nought ecclesiastical discipline, and
indulge the swelling pride of the flesh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
84. If any man should again object that
the magistrate is not indeed to resist ecclesiastical
government, yet that the abuses
thereof are to be corrected and taken away
by him, the answer is ready. In the worst
and most troublesome times, or in the decayed
and troubled estate of things, when the ordinance
of God in the church is violently
turned into tyranny, to the treading down
of true religion, and to the oppressing of the
professors thereof, and when nothing almost
is sound or whole, divers things are yielded
to be lawful to godly magistrates, which are
not ordinarily lawful for them, that so to
extraordinary diseases extraordinary remedies
may be applied. So also the magistrate
abusing his power unto tyranny, and
making havoc of all, it is lawful to resist
him by some extraordinary ways and means,
which are not ordinarily to be allowed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
85. Yet ordinarily, and by common or
known law and right in settled churches, if
any man have recourse to the magistrate to
complain, that, through abuse of ecclesiastical
discipline, injury is done to him, or if
any sentence of the pastors and elders of the
church, whether concerning faith or discipline,
do displease or seem unjust unto the
magistrate himself, it is not for that cause
lawful to draw those ecclesiastical causes to a
civil tribunal, or to bring in a kind of political
or civil popedom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
86. What then? Shall it be lawful ordinarily
for ministers and elders to do what
they list? Or shall the governors in the
churches, glorying in the law, by their
transgression dishonour God? God forbid.
For first, if they shall trespass in anything
against the magistrate or municipal
laws, whether by intermeddling in judging
of civil causes, or otherwise disturbing the
peace and order of the commonwealth, they
are liable to civil trial and judgments, and
it is in the power of the magistrate to restrain
and punish them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
87. Again, it hath been before showed,
that to ecclesiastical evils ecclesiastical remedies
are appointed and fitted, for the church
is, no less than the commonwealth, through
the grace of God, sufficient to itself in reference
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-033">[pg 5-033]</span><a name="Pg5-033" id="Pg5-033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unto her own end, and as in the commonwealth,
so in the church, the error of inferior
judgments and assemblies, or their evil
government, is to be corrected by superior
judgments and assemblies, and so still by
them of the same order, lest one order be
confounded with another, or one government
be intermingled with another government.
What shall now the adversaries of
ecclesiastical power object here, which those
who admit not the yoke of the magistrate
may not be ready, in like manner, to transfer
against the civil judicatories and government
of the commonwealth, seeing it happeneth
sometimes that the commonwealth is
no less ill governed than the church?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
88. If any man shall prosecute the argument,
and say that yet no remedy is here
showed which may be applied to the injustice
or error of a national synod, surely he
stumbleth against the same stone, seeing he
weigheth not the matter with an equal
balance, for the same may, in like sort,
fall back and be cast upon parliaments, or
any supreme senate of a commonwealth,
for who seeth not the judgment of the supreme
civil senate to be nothing more infallible,
yea, also, in matters of faith and ecclesiastical
discipline, more apt and prone to
error (as being less accustomed to sacred
studies) than the judgment of the national
synod? What medicines then, or what sovereign
plasters shall be had, which may be
fit for the curing and healing of the errors
and miscarriages of the supreme magistrates
and senate? The very like, and beside
all this, other and more effectual medicines
by which the errors of national synods may
be healed, are possible to be had.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
89. There wanteth not a divine medicine
and sovereign balm in Gilead, for although
the popish opinion of the infallibility
of counsels be worthily rejected and
exploded, yet it is not in vain that Christ
hath promised he shall be present with an
assembly which indeed and in truth meeteth
in his name with such an assembly
verily he useth to be present, by a spiritual
aid and assistance of his own Spirit, to uphold
the falling, or to raise up the fallen.
Whence it is that divers times the errors of
former synods are discovered and amended
by the latter; sometimes, also, the second
or afterthoughts of one and the same synod
are the wiser and the better.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-034">[pg 5-034]</span><a name="Pg5-034" id="Pg5-034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
90. Furthermore, the line of ecclesiastical
subordination is longer and further
stretched than the line of civil subordination;
for a national synod must be subordinate
and subject to an universal synod in
the manner aforesaid, whereas yet there is
no oecumenical parliament or general civil
court acknowledged, unto which the supreme
civil senate in this or that nation should be
subject. Finally, neither is the church altogether
destitute of nearer remedies whether
an universal council may be had or
not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
91. For the national synod ought to declare,
and that with greatest reverence, to
the magistrate, the grounds of their sentence,
and the reasons of their proceedings,
when he demandeth or inquireth into the
same, and desireth to be satisfied; but if
the magistrate nevertheless do dissent, or
cannot, by contrary reasons (which may be
brought, if he please), move the synod to
alter their judgment, yet may he require
and procure that the matter be again debated
and canvassed in another national
synod, and so the reasons of both sides
being thoroughly weighed, may be lawfully
determined in an ecclesiastical way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
92. But as there is much indeed to be
given to the demand of the magistrate, so
is there here a twofold caution to be used,
for, first, notwithstanding of a future revision,
it is necessary that the former sentence
of the synod, whether concerning the administration
of ecclesiastical discipline, or
against any heresy, be forthwith put in execution,
lest by lingering, and making of delays,
the evil of the church take deeper root,
and the gangrene spread and creep further;
and lest violence be done to the consciences
of ministers, if they be constrained to impart
the signs and seals of the covenant of
grace to dogs and swine, that is, to unclean
persons, wallowing in the mire of ungodliness;
and lest subtile men abuse such interims
or intervals, so as that ecclesiastical
discipline altogether decay, and the very
decrees of synods be accounted as cobwebs,
which none feareth to break down.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
93. Next it may be granted that the
matter may be put under a further examination,
yet upon condition, that when it is
come to the revision of the former sentence,
regard may be had of the weaker which are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-035">[pg 5-035]</span><a name="Pg5-035" id="Pg5-035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
found willing to be taught, though they
doubt; but that unto the wicked and contentious
tempters, which do mainly strive to
oppress our liberty which we have in Christ,
and to bring us into bondage, we do not for
a moment give place by subjecting ourselves;
for what else seek they or wait for, than
that, under the pretence of a revising and
of new debate, they cast in lets and impediments
ever and anon, and that by cunning
lyings in wait they may betray the liberty
of the church, and in process of time may,
by open violence, more forcibly break in
upon it, or at least constrain the ministers
of the church to weave Penelope's web,
which they can never bring to an end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
94. Moreover, the Christian magistrate
hath then only discharged his office in reference
to ecclesiastical discipline, when not
only he withdraweth nothing from it, and
maketh no impediment to it, but also affordeth
special furtherance and help to it,
according to the prophecy, Isa. xlix. 23,
<span class="tei tei-q">“And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers,
and their queens thy nursing-mothers.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
95. For Christian magistrates and princes,
embracing Christ, and sincerely giving their
names to him, do not only serve him as
men, but also use their office to his glory
and the good of the church; they defend,
stand for, and take care to propagate the
true faith and godliness,—they afford places
of habitation to the church, and furnish necessary
helps and supports,—turn away injuries
done to it,—restrain false religion,—and
cherish, underprop, and defend the
rights and liberties of the church: so far
they are from diminishing, changing or restraining
those rights; for so the condition
of the church were in that respect worse,
and the liberty thereof more cut short, under
the Christian magistrate, than under
the infidel or heathen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
96. Wherefore seeing these nursing-fathers,
favourers, and defenders, can do nothing
against the truth, but for the truth,
nor have any right against the gospel, but
for the gospel; and their power, in respect
of the church whereof they bear the care,
being not privative or destructive, but cumulative
and auxiliary, thereby it is sufficiently
clear that they ought to cherish, and
by their authority ought to establish the ecclesiastical
discipline; but yet not with implicit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-036">[pg 5-036]</span><a name="Pg5-036" id="Pg5-036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
faith, or blind obedience; for the
reformed churches do not deny to any
of the faithful, much less to the magistrate,
the judgment of Christian prudence
and discretion concerning those things
which are decreed or determined by the
church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
97. Therefore, as to each member of the
church respectively, so unto the magistrate
belongeth the judgment of such things,
both to apprehend and to judge of them;
for although the magistrate is not ordained
and preferred of God, that he should be a
judge of matters and causes spiritual, of
which there is controversy in the church,
yet is he questionless judge of his own civil
act about spiritual things; namely, of defending
them in his own dominions, and of
approving or tolerating the same; and if, in
this business, he judge and determine according
to the wisdom of the flesh, and not
according to the wisdom which is from
above, he is to render an account thereof
before the supreme tribunal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
98. However, the ecclesiastical discipline,
according as it is ordained by Christ, whether
it be established and ratified by civil
authority or not, ought to be retained and
exercised in the society of the faithful (as
long as it is free and safe for them to come
together in holy assemblies), for the want of
civil authority is unto the church like a
ceasing gain, but not like damage or loss
ensuing; as it superaddeth nothing more, so
it takes nothing away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
99. If it further happen (which God forbid)
that the magistrate do so far abuse his
authority, that he doth straitly forbid what
Christ hath ordained, yet the constant and
faithful servants of Christ will resolve and
determine with themselves, that any extremities
are rather to be undergone than that
they should obey such things, and that we
ought to obey God rather than men; yea,
they will not leave off to perform all the
parts of their office, being ready in the
meantime to render a reason of their practice
to every one that demandeth it, but
specially unto the magistrate (as was said
before).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
100. These things are not to that end
and purpose proposed, that these functions
should be opposed one against another, in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-037">[pg 5-037]</span><a name="Pg5-037" id="Pg5-037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hostile posture, or in terms of enmity, than
which nothing is more hurtful to the church
and commonwealth, nothing more execrable
to them who are truly and sincerely
zealous for the house of God (for they have
not so learned Christ); but the aim is, first,
and above all, that unto the King of kings
and Lord of lords, Jesus Christ, the only
monarch of the church, his own prerogative
royal (of which also himself in the world was
accused, and for his witnessing a good confession
thereof before Pontius Pilate, was
unjustly condemned to death) may be fully
maintained and defended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
101. Next, this debate tendeth also to this
end, that the power, as well of ecclesiastical
censure as of the civil sword, being in force,
the licentiousness of carnal men, who desire
that there be too slack ecclesiastical discipline,
or none at all, may be bridled, and
so men may sin less, and may live more
agreeably to the gospel. Another thing
here intended is, that errors on both sides
being overthrown (as well the error of those
who, under a fair pretence of maintaining
and defending the rights of magistracy, do
leave to the church either no power, or that
which is too weak, as the error of others,
who, under the veil of a certain suppositious
and imaginary Christian liberty, do turn off
the yoke of the magistrate) both powers
may enjoy their own privileges; add hereto,
that both powers being circumscribed
with their distinct borders and bounds, and
also the one underpropped and strengthened
by the help of the other, a holy concord between
them may be nourished, and they
may mutually and friendly embrace one
another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
102. Last of all, seeing there are not wanting
some unhappy men, who cease not to pervert
the right ways of the Lord, and with
all diligence go about to shake off the yoke
of the ecclesiastical discipline where now it
is about to be introduced, yea, also where it
hath been long ago established, and as yet
happily remaineth in force, it was necessary
to obviate their most wicked purposes; which
things being so, let all which hath been said
pass, with the good leave and liking of those
orthodox churches in which the discipline of
excommunication is not as yet in use; neither
can any offence easily arise to them
from hence, yea (if the best conjecture do
not deceive), they cannot but rejoice and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-038">[pg 5-038]</span><a name="Pg5-038" id="Pg5-038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
congratulate at the defence and vindication
of this discipline.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
103. For those churches do not deny,
but acknowledge and teach, that the discipline
of excommunication is most agreeable
to the word of God, as also that it ought to
be restored and exercised; which also, heretofore,
the most learned Zachary Ursine,
in the declaration of his judgment concerning
excommunication, exhibited to Prince
Frederick, the third count elector palatine,
the title whereof is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judicium de Disciplina
Ecclesiastica et Excommunicatione,
&amp;c.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
104. For thus he: <span class="tei tei-q">“In other churches
where either no excommunication is in use,
or it is not lawfully administered, and nevertheless,
without all controversy, it is confessed
and openly taught, that it ought justly
to be received and be of force in the church.”</span>
And a little after: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lest also your Highness,
by this new opinion, do sever yourself
and your churches from all other churches,
as well those which have not excommunication
as those which have it; forasmuch as
all of them do unanimously confess, and always
confessed, that there is reason why it
ought to be in use.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
105. To the same purpose it tendeth
which the highly esteemed Philip Melancthon,
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Common Places</span></span>, chap.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Of civil magistrates</span></span>, doth affirm: <span class="tei tei-q">“Before
(saith he) I warned that civil places and
powers are to be distinguished from the adhering
confusions which arise from other
causes, partly from the malice of the devil,
partly from the malice of men, partly from
the common infirmity of men, as it cometh
to pass in other kinds of life and government
ordained of God. No man doubteth
that ecclesiastical government is ordained of
God, and yet how many and great disorders
grow in it from other causes.”</span> Where he
mentioneth a church government distinct
from the civil, and that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divino</span></span>, as a
thing uncontroverted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
106. Neither were the wishes of the chief
divines of Zurich and Berne wanting for
the recalling and restoring of the discipline
of excommunication. So Bullinger, upon
1 Cor. v.: <span class="tei tei-q">“And hitherto (saith he) of the
ecclesiastical chastising of wickedness; but
here I would have the brethren diligently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-039">[pg 5-039]</span><a name="Pg5-039" id="Pg5-039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
warned, that they watch, and with all diligence
take care that this wholesome medicine,
thrown out of the true church, by occasion
of the Pope's avarice, may be reduced;
that is, that scandalous sins be punished;
for this is the very end of excommunication,
that men's manners may be well ordered,
and the saints flourish, the profane being
restrained, lest wicked men, by their impudence
and impiety, increase and undo all.
It is our part, O brethren, with greatest
diligence, to take care of those things; for
we see that Paul, in this place, doth stir up
those that were negligent in this business.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
107. Aretius agreeth hereunto. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Problem.
Theolog.</span></span>, loc. 33: <span class="tei tei-q">“Magistrates do not
admit the yoke; they are afraid for their
honours; they love licentiousness,”</span> &amp;c.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The common people are too dissolute;
the greatest part is most corrupt,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
the meanwhile, I willingly confess that we
are not to despair, but the age following
will peradventure yield more tractable spirits,
more mild hearts than our times have.”</span>
See also Lavater agreeing in this, homil.
52, on Nehemiah: <span class="tei tei-q">“Because the popes of
Rome have abused excommunication, for the
establishing of their own tyranny, it cometh
to pass that almost no just discipline can be
any more settled in the church; but unless
the wicked be restrained, all things must of
necessity run into the worst condition.”</span> See,
besides, the opinion of Fabritius upon Psal.
cxlix. 6-9, of spiritual corrections, which
he groundeth upon that text compared with
Matt. xvi. 19; xviii. 18; John xx. 23.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
108. It can hardly be doubted or called
in question, but besides these, other learned
and godly divines of those churches were
and are of the same mind herein with those
now cited; and, indeed, the very Confession
of Faith of the churches of Helvetia, chap.
18, may be an evidence hereof: <span class="tei tei-q">“But there
ought to be, in the meantime, a just discipline
amongst ministers, for the doctrine
and life of ministers is diligently to be inquired
of in synods: those that sin are to
be rebuked of the elders, and to be brought
again into the way, if they be curable; or
to be deposed, and, like wolves, driven away
from the flock of the Lord, if they be incurable.”</span>
That this manner of synodical censure,
namely, of deposing ministers from
their office for some great scandal, is used
in the republic of Zurich, Lavater is witness,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-040">[pg 5-040]</span><a name="Pg5-040" id="Pg5-040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in his book of the rites and ordinances
of the church of Zurich, chap. 23. Surely
they could not be of that mind, that ecclesiastical
discipline ought to be exercised upon
delinquent ministers only, and not also upon
other rotten members of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
109. Yea, the Helvetian Confession, in
the place now cited, doth so tax the inordinate
zeal of the Donatists and Anabaptists
(which are so bent upon the rooting out of
the tares out of the Lord's field, that they
take not heed of the danger of plucking up
the wheat) that withal it doth not obscurely
commend the ecclesiastical forensical discipline
as distinct from the civil power; <span class="tei tei-q">“And
seeing (say they) it is altogether necessary
that there be in the church a discipline;
and among the ancients, in times past, excommunication
hath been usual, and ecclesiastical
courts have been among the people
of God, among whom this discipline was exercised
by prudent and godly men. It belongeth
also to ministers, according to the
case of the times, the public estate and necessity
to moderate this discipline,—where
this rule is ever to be held, that all ought to
be done to edification, decently, honestly,
without tyranny and sedition. The Apostle
also witnesseth (2 Cor. xiii.), that to himself
was given of God a power unto edification,
and not unto destruction.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
110. And, now, what resteth but that
God be entreated with continual and ardent
prayers, both that he would put into the
hearts of all magistrates, zeal and care to
cherish, defend, and guard the ecclesiastical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5-041">[pg 5-041]</span><a name="Pg5-041" id="Pg5-041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
discipline, together with the rest of Christ's
ordinances, and to stop their ears against
the importunate suits of whatsoever claw-backs
who would stir them up against the
church; and that, also, all governors and
rulers of churches, being everywhere furnished
and helped with the strength of the
Holy Spirit, may diligently and faithfully
execute this part also of their function, as it
becometh the trusty servants of Christ,
who study to please their own Lord and
Master more than men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
111. Finally, All those who are more
averse from ecclesiastical discipline, or ill-affected
against it, are to be admonished and
entreated, through our Lord Jesus Christ,
that they be no longer entangled and inveigled
with carnal prejudice, to give place
in this thing to human affections, and to
measure by their own corrupt reason spiritual
discipline, but that they do seriously
think with themselves, and consider in their
minds, how much better it were that the
lusts of the flesh were, as with a bridle,
tamed; and that the repentance, amendment,
and gaining of vicious men unto salvation
may be sought, than that sinners be
left to their own disposition, and be permitted
to follow their own lusts without controlment,
and by their evil example to draw
others headlong into ruin with themselves;
and seeing either the keys of discipline must
take no rust, or the manners of Christians
will certainly contract much rust: what is
here to be chosen, and what is to be shunned,
let the wise and godly, who alone take
to heart the safety of the church, judge.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Divine providence hath made it my lot, and a
calling hath induced me (who am less than the least
of all the servants of Christ) to appear among others
in this cloud of public witnesses. The scope of the
sermon is to endeavour the removal of the obstructions,
both of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">humiliation</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reformation</span></em>; two
things which ought to lie very much in our thoughts
at this time. Concerning both I shall preface but
little. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reformation</span></span> hath many unfriends, some upon
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the right hand</span></em>, and some upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the left</span></em>; while
others cry up that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">detestable indifferency</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">neutrality</span></em>,
abjured in our solemn covenant, insomuch that
Gamaliel (Acts v. 38, 39) and Gallio (Acts xviii.
14-17), men who regarded alike the Jewish and
the Christian religion, are highly commended, as
<span class="tei tei-q">“examples for all Christians,”</span><a id="noteref_1361" name="noteref_1361" href="#note_1361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a> and as men walking
by the rules not only of policy, but of <span class="tei tei-q">“reason
and religion.”</span> Now, let all those that are either
against us or not with us do what they can, the
right hand of the most High shall perfect the glorious
begun reformation. Can all the world keep
down <span class="tei tei-q">“the Sun of Righteousness”</span> from rising? or,
being risen, can they spread a vail over it? And
though they dig deep to hide their counsels, is not
this a time of God's overreaching and befooling all
plotting wits? They have conceived iniquity, and
they shall bring forth vanity: <span class="tei tei-q">“They have sown the
wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind”</span> (Hos. viii.
7). Wherefore we <span class="tei tei-q">“will wait upon the Lord, that
hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and will
look for him”</span> (Isa. viii. 17); and <span class="tei tei-q">“though he slay
us, yet will we trust in him”</span> (Job xiii. 15). The
Lord hath commanded to proclaim, and to say <span class="tei tei-q">“to
the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh”</span>
(Isa. lxii. 11); <span class="tei tei-q">“Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, all
ye that mourn for her”</span> (Isa. lxvi. 10); for <span class="tei tei-q">“behold,
now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of
salvation”</span> (2 Cor. vi. 2). But I have more to say:
Mourn, O mourn with Jerusalem, all ye that rejoice
for her; <span class="tei tei-q">“This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke,
and of blasphemy: for the children are come to
the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth”</span>
(Isa. xxxvii. 3): it is an interwoven time, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">warped</span></em> with
mercies, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">woofted</span></em> with judgments. Say not thou
in thine heart, The days of my mourning are at an
end: Oh! we are to this day an unhumbled and
an unprepared people; and there are among us
both many cursed Achans, and many sleeping Jonahs,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-iii">[pg 6-iii]</span><a name="Pg6-iii" id="Pg6-iii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but few wrestling Jacobs; even the wise virgins
are slumbering with the foolish (Matt. xxv.
5): surely, unless we be timely awakened, and more
deeply humbled, God will punish us yet <span class="tei tei-q">“seven
times”</span> (Lev. xxvi. 18, 21, 24, 28) more for our sins;
and if he hath chastised us with <span class="tei tei-q">“whips,”</span> he will
<span class="tei tei-q">“chastise us with scorpions;”</span> and he will yet give a
further charge to the sword to <span class="tei tei-q">“avenge the quarrel
of his covenant”</span> (Lev, xxvi. 25). In such a case, I
cannot say, according to the now Oxford divinity,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">preces et lachrymae</span></span>,—prayers and tears,—must
be our only one shelter and fortress, and that we
must cast away defensive arms, as unlawful, in any
case whatsoever, against the supreme magistrate
(that is, by interpretation, they would have us do
no more than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pray</span></em>, to the end themselves may do
no less than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prey)</span></em>; wherein they are contradicted
not only by Pareus, and by others that are <span class="tei tei-q">“eager
for a presbytery”</span> (as a prelate<a id="noteref_1362" name="noteref_1362" href="#note_1362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1362</span></span></a> of chief note hath
lately taken, I should say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mistaken</span></em>, his mark), but
even by those that are <span class="tei tei-q">“eager royalists”</span><a id="noteref_1363" name="noteref_1363" href="#note_1363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1363</span></span></a> (pardon
me that I give them not their right name: I am
sure, when all is well reckoned, we are better friends
to royal authority than themselves). Yet herein I
do agree with them, that <span class="tei tei-q">“prayers and tears”</span> will
prove our strongest weapons, and the only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tela divina</span></span>,
the weapons that fight for us from above: O
then <span class="tei tei-q">“fear the Lord, ye his saints”</span> (Psal. xxxiv. 9);
O stir up yourselves to lay hold on him (Isa. lxiv.
7); <span class="tei tei-q">“Keep not silence; and give him no rest, till
he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in
the earth”</span> (Isa. lxii. 6, 7). O that we could all
make wells in our dry and desert-like hearts (Psal.
lxxxiv. 6), that we may draw out water (1 Sam. vii.
6), even buckets-full, to quench the wrath of a sin-revenging
God, the fire which still burneth against
the Lord's inheritance. God grant that this sermon
be not <span class="tei tei-q">“as water spilt on the ground”</span> but
may <span class="tei tei-q">“drop as the rain”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“distil as the dew”</span>
(Deut. xxxii. 2) of heaven upon thy soul.

It is not long since I did, upon another
day of humiliation, lay open England's disease
from that text, 2 Chron. xx. 33, <span class="tei tei-q">“Howbeit
the high places were not taken away;
for as yet the people had not prepared
their hearts unto the God of their fathers.”</span>
Though the Sun of Righteousness
be risen, Mal. iv. 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“with healing in his
wings,”</span> yet the land is not healed, no, not
of its worst disease, which is corruption in
religion, and the iniquity of your holy
things. I did then show the symptoms,
and the cause of this evil disease. The
symptoms are your high places not yet
taken away, many of your old superstitious
ceremonies to this day remaining, which,
though not so evil as the high places of
idolatry in which idols were worshipped,
yet are parallel to the high places of will-worship,
of which we read that the people,
thinking it too hard to be tied to go up to
Jerusalem with every sacrifice, <span class="tei tei-q">“did sacrifice
still in the high places, yet unto the
Lord their God only,”</span> 2 Chron. xxxiii, 17;
pleading for their so doing, antiquity, custom,
and other defences of that kind, which
have been alleged for your ceremonies. But
albeit these be foul spots in the church's
face, which offend the eyes of her glorious
Bridegroom, Jesus Christ, yet that which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-002">[pg 6-002]</span><a name="Pg6-002" id="Pg6-002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doth less appear is more dangerous, and
that is the cause of all this evil in the very
bowels and heart of the church; the people
of the land, great and small, have not as
yet prepared their hearts unto the Lord
their God; mercy is prepared for the land,
but the land is not prepared for mercy. I
shall say no more of the disease at this instant.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I have now chosen a text which holds
forth a remedy for this malady—a cure
for this case; that is, that if we will humble
our uncircumcised hearts, and accept of
the punishment of our iniquity, Lev. xxvi.
41; if we be <span class="tei tei-q">“ashamed and confounded”</span>
(Ezek. xxxvi. 32), before the Lord this
day for our evil ways; if we judge ourselves
as guilty, and put our mouth in the
dust, and clothe ourselves with shame as
with a garment; if we repent and abhor
ourselves in dust and ashes, then the Lord
will not abhor us, but take pleasure in us,
to dwell among us, to reveal himself unto
us, to set before us the right pattern of his
own house, that the tabernacle of God may
be with men, Rev. xxi. 3; and pure ordinances,
where before they were defiled and
mixed; Zech. xiii. 2, He <span class="tei tei-q">“will cut off the
names of the idols out of the land,”</span> and
cause the false prophet, <span class="tei tei-q">“and the unclean
spirit to pass out of the land,”</span> and the glory
of the Lord shall dwell in the land, Psal.
lxxxv. 9. But, withal, we must take heed
that we <span class="tei tei-q">“turn not again to folly,”</span> Psal.
lxxxv. 8; that our hearts start not aside,
<span class="tei tei-q">“like a deceitful bow,”</span> Psal. lxxviii. 57;
that we <span class="tei tei-q">“keep the ways of the Lord,”</span> Psal.
xviii. 21, and do not wickedly depart from
our God. Thus you have briefly the occasion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-003">[pg 6-003]</span><a name="Pg6-003" id="Pg6-003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the sum of what I am to deliver
from this text; the particulars whereof
I shall not touch till I have, in the first
place, resolved a difficult, yet profitable
question.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You may ask, What house or what temple
doth the Prophet here speak of, and how
can it be made to appear that this scripture
is applicable to this time?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I answer, Some<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364" href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a> have taken great pains
to demonstrate that this temple, which the
Prophet saw in this vision, was no other than
the temple of Solomon; and that the accomplishment
of this vision of the temple, city,
and division of the land, was the building of
the temple and city again after the captivity,
and the restoring of the Levitical worship
and Jewish republic, which came to
pass in the days of Nehemiah and Zorobabel.
This sense is also most obvious to every
one that readeth this prophecy; but there
are very strong reasons against it, which
make other learned expositors not to embrace
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, 1. The temple of Solomon was one
hundred and twenty cubits high, the temple
built by Zorobabel was but sixty cubits high,
Ezra vi. 3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The temple of Zorobabel (Ezra iii. 1,
8, vi. 3, 5, 7) was built in the same place
where the temple of Solomon was, that is,
in Jerusalem, upon mount Moriah, but this
temple of Ezekiel was without the city, and
a great way distant from it,<a id="noteref_1365" name="noteref_1365" href="#note_1365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1365</span></span></a> chap. xlviii.
10 compared with ver. 15. The whole portion
of the Levites, and a part of the portion
of the priests, was betwixt the temple
and the city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Moses' greatest altar,—the altar of
burnt-offerings, was not half so big as Ezekiel's
altar, compare Ezek. xliii. 16 with
Exod. xxvii. 1,<a id="noteref_1366" name="noteref_1366" href="#note_1366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1366</span></span></a> so is Moses' altar of incense
much less than Ezekiel's altar of incense,
Exod. xxx. 2 compared with Ezek. xli. 22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. There are many new ceremonial laws,
different from the Mosaical, delivered in the
following part of this vision, chap. xlv. and
xlvi., as interpreters have particularly observed
upon these places.<a id="noteref_1367" name="noteref_1367" href="#note_1367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1367</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The temple and city were not of that
greatness which is described in this vision;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-004">[pg 6-004]</span><a name="Pg6-004" id="Pg6-004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the measuring reed, containing six cubits
of the sanctuary, not common cubits (chap.
xl. 5), which amount to more than ten feet,
the outer wall of the temple being two
thousand reeds in compass (chap. xlii. 20),
was by estimation four miles, and the city
(chap. xlviii. 16, 35) thirty-six miles in
compass.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The vision of the holy waters (chap.
xlvii.) issuing from the temple, and after
the space of four thousand reeds growing
to a river which could not be passed over,
and healing the waters and the fishes, cannot
be literally understood of the temple at
Jerusalem.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The land is divided among the twelve
tribes (chap. xlviii.), and that in a way and
order different from the division made by
Joshua, which cannot be understood of the
restitution after the captivity, because the
twelve tribes did not return.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. This new temple hath with it a new
covenant, and that an everlasting one, Ezek.
xxxvii. 26, 27. But at the return of the
people from Babylon there was no new covenant,
saith Irenæus,<a id="noteref_1368" name="noteref_1368" href="#note_1368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1368</span></span></a> only the same that
was before continued till Christ's coming.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherefore we must needs hold with Jerome,<a id="noteref_1369" name="noteref_1369" href="#note_1369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1369</span></span></a> Gregory,<a id="noteref_1370" name="noteref_1370" href="#note_1370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1370</span></span></a> and other later interpreters,
that this vision is to be expounded
of the spiritual temple and church of Christ,
made up of Jews and Gentiles; and that not
by way of allegories only, which is the sense
of those whose opinion I have now confuted,
but according to the proper and direct intendment
of the vision, which, in many material
points, cannot agree to Zorobabel's
temple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am herein very much strengthened
while I observe many parallel passages<a id="noteref_1371" name="noteref_1371" href="#note_1371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1371</span></span></a> betwixt
the vision of Ezekiel and the revelation
of John; and while I remember withal,
that the prophets do in many places foretell
the institution of the ordinances, government
and worship of the New Testament,
under the terms of temple, priests, sacrifices,
&amp;c., and do set forth the deliverance and
stability of the church of Christ, under the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-005">[pg 6-005]</span><a name="Pg6-005" id="Pg6-005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
notions of Canaan, of bringing back the captivity,
&amp;c., God speaking to his people at
that time, so as they might best understand
him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now if you ask how the several particulars
in the vision may be particularly
expounded and applied to the church of
Christ, I answer The word of God, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“river that makes glad the city of God,”</span>
though it have many easy and known fords
where any of Christ's lambs may pass
through, yet in this vision, and other places
of this kind, it is <span class="tei tei-q">“a great deep”</span> where the
greatest elephant, as he said, may swim.
I shall not say with the Jews, that one
should not read the last nine chapters of
Ezekiel before he be thirty years old.
Surely a man may be twice thirty years
old, and a good divine too, and yet not able
to understand this vision. Some tell us,
that no man can understand it without skill
in geometry, which cannot be denied, but
there is greater need of ecclesiometry, if I
may so speak, to measure the church in her
length, or continuance through many generations,
in her breadth, or spreading through
many nations, her depth of humiliation,
sorrows and sufferings, her height of faith,
hope, joy, and comfort, and to measure
each part according to this pattern here set
before us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherein, for my part, I must profess (as
Socrates in another case), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scio quod nescio</span></span>.
I know that there is a great mystery here
which I cannot reach. Only I shall set forth
unto you that little light which the Father
of lights hath given me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I conceive that the Holy Ghost in this
vision hath pointed at four several times and
conditions of the church,—that we may take
with us the full meaning, without addition
or diminution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Observing this rule, That what agreeth
not to the type must be meant of the thing
typified, and what is not fulfilled at one
time must be fulfilled of the church at another
time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, It cannot be denied that he
points in some sort at the restitution of the
temple, worship of God, and city of Jerusalem,
after the captivity, as a type of the
church of Christ, for though many things
in the vision do not agree to that time, as
hath been proved, yet some things do agree
this, as it is least intended in the vision, so
it is not fit for me at this time to insist
upon it. But he that would understand the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-006">[pg 6-006]</span><a name="Pg6-006" id="Pg6-006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
form of the temple of Jerusalem, the several
parts, and excellent structure thereof,
will find enough written of that subject.<a id="noteref_1372" name="noteref_1372" href="#note_1372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1372</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, This and other prophecies of
building again the temple, may well be applied
to the building of the Christian church
by the master-builders, the apostles, and by
other ministers of the gospel since their days.
Let us hear but two witnesses of the apostles
themselves applying those prophecies
to the calling of the Gentiles: the one is
Paul, 2 Cor. vi. 16, <span class="tei tei-q">“For ye are the temple
of the living God; as God hath said, I
will dwell in them, and walk in them; and
I will be their God, and they shall be my
people;”</span> the other is James, who applieth
to the converted Gentiles that prophecy of
Amos, <span class="tei tei-q">“After this I will return, and will
build again the tabernacle of David, which
is fallen down; and I will build again the
ruins thereof, and I will set it up,”</span> Acts
xv. 16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, But there is a third thing aimed
at in this prophecy, and that more principally
than any of the other two, which is
the repairing of the breaches and ruins of
the Christian church, and the building up
of Zion in her glory, about the time of the
destruction of Antichrist and the conversion
of the Jews; and this happiness hath the
Lord reserved to the last times, to build a
more excellent and glorious temple than
former generations have seen. I mean not
of the building of the material temple at
Jerusalem, which the Jews do fancy and
look for,—but I speak of the church and
people of God; and that I may not seem to
expound an obscure prophecy too conjecturally,
which many in these days do, I have
these evidences following for what I say:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. If Paul and James, in those places
which I last cited, do apply the prophecies
of building a new temple to the first-fruits
of the Gentiles, and to their first conversion,
then they are much more to be applied
to the fulness of the Gentiles, and,
most of all, to the fulness both of Jews and
Gentiles, which we wait for. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, if the
fall of them (saith the Apostle, speaking of
the Jews) be the riches of the world, and
the diminishing of them the riches of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-007">[pg 6-007]</span><a name="Pg6-007" id="Pg6-007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Gentiles; how much more their fulness?”</span>
Rom. xi. 12. And again, <span class="tei tei-q">“If the casting
away of them be the reconciling of the
world, what shall the receiving of them be,
but life from the dead?”</span> ver. 15. Plainly
insinuating a greater increase of the church,
and a larger spread of the gospel at the conversion
of the Jews, and so a fairer temple,
yea, another world, in a manner, to be
looked for.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Lord himself, in this same chapter,
ver. 7, speaking of the temple here prophesied
of, saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“The place of my throne,
and the place of the soles of my feet, where
I will dwell in the midst of the children of
Israel for ever, and my holy name shall the
house of Israel no more defile, neither they
nor their kings,”</span> &amp;c.; which, as it cannot
be understood of the Jews after the captivity,
who did again forsake the Lord, and
were forsaken of him, as Jerome noteth
upon the place, so it can as ill be said to be
already fulfilled upon the Christian church,
but rather that such a church is yet to be
expected in which the Lord shall take up
his dwelling for ever, and shall not be provoked
by their defilements and whoredoms
again to take away his kingdom and to remove
the candlestick.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. This last temple is also prophesied of
by Isaiah, chap. ii. 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall come
to pass in the last days, that the mountain
of the Lord's house shall be established in
the top of the mountains (even as here Ezekiel
did see this temple upon a very high
mountain, chap. lx. 2), and shall be exalted
above the hills; and all nations shall
flow unto it,”</span> &amp;c.; ver. 4, <span class="tei tei-q">“And they shall
beat their swords into plow-shares, and their
spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not
lift up sword against nation, neither shall
they learn war any more.”</span> Here is the
building of such a temple as shall bring
peaceable and quiet times to the church, of
which that evangelical prophet speaketh in
other places also, Isa. xi. 9; lx. 17, 18.
And if we shall read that which followeth,
Isa. ii. 5, as the Chaldee paraphrase doth,
<span class="tei tei-q">“And the men of the house of Jacob shall
say, Come ye,”</span> &amp;c., then the building of
the temple there spoken of shall appear to
be joined with the Jews' conversion; but,
howsoever, it is joined with a great peace
and calm, such as yet the church hath not
seen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. We find in this vision, that when
Ezekiel's temple shall be built, princes shall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-008">[pg 6-008]</span><a name="Pg6-008" id="Pg6-008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no more oppress the people of God, nor defile
the name of God, Ezek. xlv. 8; xliii. 7;<a id="noteref_1373" name="noteref_1373" href="#note_1373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1373</span></span></a> which are in like manner joined, Psal. cii.
15, 16, 22, <span class="tei tei-q">“The heathen shall fear the
name of the Lord, and all the kings of the
earth thy glory. When the Lord shall
build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory;
when the people are gathered together, and
the kingdoms (understand here also kings,
as the Septuagint do), to serve the Lord;”</span>
which psalm is acknowledged to be a prophecy
of the kingdom of Christ, though under
the type of bringing back the captivity
of the Jews, and of the building again of
Zion at that time. The like prophecy of
Christ we have Psal. lxxii. 11, <span class="tei tei-q">“All kings
shall fall down before him; all nations shall
serve him.”</span> But I ask, Have not the kings
of the earth hitherto, for the most part, set
themselves <span class="tei tei-q">“against the Lord, and against
his Anointed”</span>? Psal. ii. 2. And how then
shall all those prophecies hold true, except
they be coincident with Rev. xvii. 16, 17,
and that time is yet to come, when God
shall put it in the hearts of kings to <span class="tei tei-q">“hate
the whore (of Rome), and they shall make
her desolate and naked, and shall eat her
flesh, and burn her with fire”</span>? It is foretold
that God shall do this great and good
work even by those kings who have before
subjected themselves to Antichrist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. That which I now draw from Ezekiel's
vision is no other but the same which
was showed to John, Rev. xi. 1, 2,—a place
so like to this of Ezekiel, that we must take
special notice of it, and make that serve for
a commentary to this,—<span class="tei tei-q">“And there was
given me (saith John) a reed like unto
a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise,
and measure the temple of God, and the
altar, and them that worship therein. But
the court which is without the temple leave
out, and measure it not; for it is given unto
the Gentiles; and the holy city shall they
tread under foot forty and two months.”</span>
This time of forty and two months must
be expounded by Rev. xiii. 5, where it is
said of the beast, <span class="tei tei-q">“Power was given unto
him, to continue forty and two months;”</span>
which, according to the computation of
Egyptian years (reckoning thirty days to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-009">[pg 6-009]</span><a name="Pg6-009" id="Pg6-009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
each month), make three years and a half,
or twelve hundred and sixty days, and that
is the time of the witnesses' prophesying in
sackcloth, and of the woman's abode in the
wilderness, Rev, xi. 3; xii. 6. Now lest it
should be thought that the treading down
of the holy city by the Gentiles (that is, the
treading under foot of the true church, the
city of God, by the tyranny of Antichrist
and the power of his accomplices) should
never have an end in this world, the angel
gives John to understand that the church,
the house of the living God, shall not lie desolate
for ever, but shall be built again (for
the measuring is in reference to building),
that the kingdom of Antichrist shall come
to an end, and that after twelve hundred
and sixty years, counting days for years as
the prophets do. It is not to my purpose
now to search when this time of the power
of the beast and of the church's desolation
did begin, and when it ends, and so to
find out the time of building this new temple,—only
this much I trust, I may say,
that if we reckon from the time that the
power of the beast did begin, and, withal,
consider the great revolution and turning
of things upside down in these our days,
certainly the work is upon the wheel; the
Lord hath plucked his hand out of his
bosom, he hath whet his sword, he hath
bent his bow, he hath also prepared the instruments
of death against Antichrist: so
saith the Psalmist of all persecutors, Psal.
vii. 12, 13; but it will fall most upon that
capital enemy. Whereof there will be occasion
to say more afterward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let me here only add a word concerning
a fourth thing which the Holy Ghost may
seem to intend in this prophecy, and that is,
the church triumphant, the new <span class="tei tei-q">“Jerusalem
which is above,”</span> unto which respect is
to be had, as interpreters judge, in some
parts of the vision, which happily cannot be
so well applied to the church in this world.
Even as the new Jerusalem is so described
in the Revelation (Rev. xxi.), that it may
appear to be the church of Christ, reformed,
beautified, and enlarged in this world,
and fully perfected and glorified in the
world to come; and as many things which
are said of it can very hardly be made to
agree to the church in this world; so other
things which are said of it can as hardly be
applied to the church glorified in heaven, as
where it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the tabernacle of
God is with men, [having come down from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-010">[pg 6-010]</span><a name="Pg6-010" id="Pg6-010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God out of heaven] and he will dwell with
them, and they shall be his people, and
God himself shall be with them, and be
their God,”</span> ver. 3. Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the nations
of them which are saved shall walk in
the light of it: and the kings of the earth
do bring their glory and honour into it,”</span>
ver. 24.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But now I make haste to the several particulars
contained in my text: <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray God
(saith the Apostle) your whole spirit, and
soul, and body, be preserved blameless,”</span>
1 Thess. v. 23; Phil. i. 9, 11. And what
he there prays for, this text, rightly understood
and applied, may work in us, that is,
gracious affections, gracious minds, gracious
actions. In the first place, a change upon
our corrupt and wicked affections,—<span class="tei tei-q">“If
they be ashamed of all that they have
done,”</span> saith the Lord; Secondly, A change
upon our blind minds,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Show them the
form of the house, and the fashion thereof,”</span>
&amp;c.; Thirdly, A change also upon our actions,—<span class="tei tei-q">“That
they may keep the whole
form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof,
and do them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the first, the words here used is not
that which signifieth blushing through modesty,
but it signifieth shame for that which
is indeed shameful, filthy, and abominable,<a id="noteref_1374" name="noteref_1374" href="#note_1374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1374</span></span></a>
so that it were impenitency and an aggravation
of the fault not to be ashamed for it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall here build only one doctrine,
which will be of exceeding great use for
such a day as this: <span class="tei tei-q">“If either we would
have mercy to ourselves, or would do acceptable
service in the public reformation,
we must not only cease to do evil and learn
to do well, but also be ashamed, confounded
and humbled, for our former evil ways.”</span>
Here is a twofold necessity, which presseth
upon us this duty,—to loathe and abhor
ourselves for all our abominations, to be
greatly abashed and confounded before our
God: First, Without this we shall not find
grace and favour to our own souls; Secondly,
We shall else miscarry in the work of
reformation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, I say, let us do all the good we
can, God is not pleased with us unless we
be ashamed and humbled for former guiltiness.
Be zealous and repent (Rev. iii.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-011">[pg 6-011]</span><a name="Pg6-011" id="Pg6-011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
19), saith Christ to the Laodiceans; be zealous
in time coming, and repent of your former
lukewarmness: <span class="tei tei-q">“What fruit had ye
then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?”</span> (Rom. vi. 21,) saith the Apostle
to the saints at Rome, of whom he saith
plainly, that they were <span class="tei tei-q">“servants to righteousness,”</span>
(ver. 19;) and had their <span class="tei tei-q">“fruit
unto holiness.”</span> But that is not all; they
were also ashamed while they looked back
upon their old faults, which is the rather to
be observed, because it maketh against the
Antinomian error now afoot.<a id="noteref_1375" name="noteref_1375" href="#note_1375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1375</span></span></a> It hath a
clear reason for it, for without this God is
still dishonoured, and not restored to his
glory: <span class="tei tei-q">“O Lord (saith Daniel), righteousness
belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion
of faces,”</span> Dan. ix. 7. These two go
together. We must be confounded, that
God may be glorified; we must be judged,
that God may be justified; our mouths
must be stopped, and laid in the dust, that
the Lord may be just when he speaketh, and
clear when he judgeth (Psal. li. 4). And as
the Apostle teacheth us, 1 Cor. xi. 31, that if
we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of
God; and, by the rule of contraries, if we
judge not ourselves, we shall be judged of
God; so say I now, if we give glory to God,
and take shame and confusion of faces to
ourselves, God shall not confound us, nor
put us to shame: but if we will not be confounded
and ashamed in ourselves, God
shall confound us, and pour shame upon
us; if we loathe not ourselves, God shall
loathe us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nay let me argue from the manner of men,
as the Prophet doth, Mal. i. 8, <span class="tei tei-q">“Offer it now
unto thy governor; will he be pleased with
thee, or accept thy person?”</span> Will thy governor,
nay, thy neighbour, who is as thou
art, alter an injury done to him, be pleased
with thee, if thou do but leave off to do him
any more such injuries? Will he not expect
an acknowledgment of the wrong done?
Is it not Christ's rule (Luke xvii. 4) that
he who seven times trespasseth against his
brother, seven times turn again, saying, I
repent? David would hardly trust Ittai
to go up and down with him, who was
but a stranger (2 Sam. xv. 19), how much
more if he had done him some great wrong,
and then refused to confess it? And how
shall we think that it can stand with the
honour of the most high God, that we seem
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-012">[pg 6-012]</span><a name="Pg6-012" id="Pg6-012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to draw near unto him, and to walk in his
ways, while, in the meantime, we do not acknowledge
our iniquity, and even accuse,
shame, judge, and condemn ourselves? Nay,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be not deceived, God is not mocked,”</span>
Gal. vi. 7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the first necessity of the duty
which this text holdeth forth. The Lord
requireth of us not only to do his will for the
future, but to be ashamed for what we have
done amiss before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other necessity of it, which is also in
the text, is this: That except we be thus
ashamed and humbled, God hath not promised
to show us the pattern of his house,
nor to reveal his will unto us; which agreeth
well with that, Psal. xxv. 9, <span class="tei tei-q">“The meek
will he teach his way;”</span> and ver. 12, <span class="tei tei-q">“What
man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall
he teach in the way that he shall choose;”</span>
and ver. 14, <span class="tei tei-q">“The secret of the Lord is
with them that fear him, and he will show
them his covenant.”</span> There is sanctification
in the affections, and here is humiliation in
the affections, spoken of as necessary means
of attaining the knowledge of the will of
God. Let the affections be ordered aright,
then light which is offered shall be seen and
received; but let light be offered when disordered
affections do overcloud the eye of
the mind, then all is in vain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this case a man shall be like <span class="tei tei-q">“the
deaf adder”</span> (Psal. lviii. 4, 5,) which will
not be taken by the voice of the charmers,
<span class="tei tei-q">“charming never so wisely.”</span> Let the helm
of reason be stirred as well as you can imagine,
if there be a contrary wind in the
sails of the affections, the ship will not answer
to the helm. It is a good argument:
He is a wicked man, a covetous man,
a proud man, a carnal man, an unhumbled
man; therefore he will readily miscarry
in his judgment. So divines have argued
against the Pope's infallibility! The
Pope hath been, and may be a profane
man; therefore he may err in his judgment
and decrees. And what wonder that they
who receive not the love of the truth be
given over to <span class="tei tei-q">“strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie?”</span> 2 Thess. ii. 9, 10.
It is as good an argument: He is a humbled
man, and a man that feareth God;
therefore, in so far as he acteth and exerciseth
those graces, the Lord shall teach
him in the way that he shall choose. I say,
in so far as he acteth those graces,—because
when he grieves the Spirit, and cherisheth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-013">[pg 6-013]</span><a name="Pg6-013" id="Pg6-013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the flesh, when the child of God is more
swayed by his corruptions than by his graces,
then he is in great danger to be given up to
the counsel of his own heart, and to be deserted
by the Holy Ghost, which should
lead him <span class="tei tei-q">“into all truth,”</span> John xvi. 13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we must take notice of a seeming
contradiction here in the text. God saith
to the Prophet in the former verse, <span class="tei tei-q">“Show
the house to the house of Israel, that they
may be ashamed of their iniquities;”</span> and,
Jer. xxxi. 19, Ephraim is first instructed,
then ashamed. And here it is quite turned
over in my text; if they be ashamed show
them the house.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall not here make any digression
unto the debates and distinctions of schoolmen,
what influence and power the affections
have upon the understanding and the
will; I will content myself with this plain
answer: Those two might very well stand
together,—light is a help to humiliation,
and humiliation a help to light. As there
must be some work of faith, and some apprehension
of the love of God, in order before
true evangelical repentance, yet this repentance
helpeth us to believe more firmly
that our sins are forgiven. The soul, in the
pains of the new birth, is like Tamar travailing
of her twins, Pharez and Zarah (Gen.
xxxviii. 28-30): faith, like Zarah, first
putting out his hand, but hath no strength
to come forth, therefore draweth back the
hand again, till repentance, like Pharez,
have broken forth,—then can faith come
forth more easily. Which appeareth in
that woman, Luke vii. 47, 48: she wept
much, because she loved much; she loved
much, because she believed; and by faith
had her heart enlarged with apprehending
the rich grace and free love of Christ to
poor sinners: this faith moves her bowels,
melts her heart, stirs her sorrow, kindles
her affection. Then, and not till
then, she gets a prop to her faith, and a
sure ground to build upon. It is not till
she have wept much that Christ intimates
mercy, and saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy sins are forgiven
thee.”</span> Just so is the case in this text:
Show them the house, saith the Lord, that
they may be ashamed; give them a view of
it, that they may think the worse of themselves,
that they want it, that they may be
ashamed for all their iniquities, whereby
they have separate betwixt their God and
themselves, so that they cannot <span class="tei tei-q">“behold the
beauty of the Lord,”</span> nor <span class="tei tei-q">“inquire in his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-014">[pg 6-014]</span><a name="Pg6-014" id="Pg6-014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
temple,”</span> Psal. xxvii. 4; and if, when they
begin to see it, they have such thoughts as
these, and humble themselves, and acknowledge
their iniquities, then go to and show
them the whole fabric, and structure, and all
the gates thereof, and all the parts thereof,
and all things pertaining thereto.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I suppose I have said enough for confirmation
and clearing of the doctrine concerning
the necessity of our being ashamed
and confounded before the Lord. I have
now a fourfold application to draw from it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first application shall be to the malignant
enemies of the cause and people of
God at this time, who deserve Jeremiah's
black mark to be put upon them: <span class="tei tei-q">“Were
they ashamed when they had committed abomination?
nay, they wore not at all ashamed,
neither could they blush,”</span> Jer. vi. 15;
viii. 12. When he would say the worst of
them, this is it: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hadst a whore's
forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed,”</span>
Jer. iii. 3. There are some sons of Belial
risen up against us, who have done some
things whereof, I dare say, many heathens
would have been ashamed; yet they are as
far from being ashamed of their outrages as
Caligula was, who said of himself, that he
loved nothing better in his own nature than
that he could not be ashamed: nay, their
glory is their shame, Phil. iii. 19; and if
the Lord do not open their eyes to see
their shame, their end will be destruction.
Is it a light matter to swear and blaspheme,
to coin and spread lies, to devise calumnies,
to break treaties, to contrive treacherous
plots, to exercise so many barbarous cruelties,
to shed so much blood, and, as if that
were too little, to bury men quick? Is all
this no matter of shame? And when they
have so often professed to be for the true
Protestant religion, shall they not be ashamed
to thirst so much after Protestant blood,
and in that cause desire to associate themselves
with all the Papists at home and
abroad whose assistance they can have, and
particularly with those matchless monsters
(they call them subjects) of Ireland, who, if
the computation fail not, have shed the
blood of some hundred thousands in that
kingdom? For our part, it seems they are
resolved to give the worst name to the best
thing which we can do, and therefore they
have not been ashamed to call a religious
and loyal covenant a traitorous and damnable
covenant. I have no pleasure to take
up these and other dunghills, the text hath
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-015">[pg 6-015]</span><a name="Pg6-015" id="Pg6-015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
put this in my mouth which I have said. O
that they could recover themselves out of
the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity,
Acts viii. 23; O that we could hear that
they begin to be ashamed of their abominations,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, when thy hand is lifted up,
they will not see: but they shall see, and be
ashamed for their envy at the people,”</span> Isa.
xxvi. 11; the Lord <span class="tei tei-q">“shall appear to your
joy, and they shall be ashamed,”</span> lxvi. 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But now, in the second place, let me speak
to the kingdom, and to you whom it concerneth
this day to be humbled, both for
your own sins and for the sins of the kingdom
which you represent. Although yourselves,
whom God hath placed in this honourable
station, and the kingdom which God
hath blessed with many choice blessings, be
much and worthily honoured among the
children of men, yet when you have to do
with God, and with that wherein his great
name and his glory is concerned, you must
not think of honouring, but rather abashing
yourselves, and creeping low in the dust.
Livy tells us,<a id="noteref_1376" name="noteref_1376" href="#note_1376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1376</span></span></a> that when M. Claudius Marcellus
would have dedicate a temple to Honour
and Virtue, the priests hindered it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quod
utri deo res divina fieret, sciri non posset</span></span>,
because so it could not be known to
which of the two gods he should offer sacrifice.
Far be it from any of you to suffer
the will of God and your own credit to
come in competition together, or to put back
any point of truth, because it may seem,
peradventure, some way to wound your reputation,
though, when all is well examined,
it shall be found your glory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You are now about the casting out of
many corruptions in the government of the
church and worship of God. Remember,
therefore, it is not enough to cleanse the
house of the Lord, but you must be humbled
for your former defilements wherewith
it was polluted. It is not enough that England
say with Ephraim in one place, <span class="tei tei-q">“What
have I to do any more with idols?”</span> Hos.
xiv. 8. England must say also with Ephraim
in another place, <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely after that I
was turned, I repented; and after that I
was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I
was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because
I did bear the reproach of my youth,”</span> Jer.
xxxi. 19. Let England sit down in the
dust, and wallow itself in ashes, and cry out
as the lepers did (Lev. xiii. 45), <span class="tei tei-q">“Unclean,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-016">[pg 6-016]</span><a name="Pg6-016" id="Pg6-016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unclean,”</span> and then rise up and cast away
the least superstitious ceremony <span class="tei tei-q">“as a menstruous
cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get
thee hence,”</span> Isa. xxx. 22. I know that
those who are not convinced of the intrinsical
evil and unlawfulness of former corruptions
may, upon other considerations, go
along and join in this reformation; for according
to Augustine's rule,<a id="noteref_1377" name="noteref_1377" href="#note_1377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1377</span></span></a> men are to let
go those ecclesiastical customs which neither
Scriptures nor councils bind upon us, nor
yet are universally received by all churches.
And according to Ambrose's rule to Valentinian,
epist. 31, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nullus pudor est ad meliora
transive</span></span>,—it is no shame to change
that which is not so good for that which is
better. So doth Arnobius<a id="noteref_1378" name="noteref_1378" href="#note_1378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1378</span></span></a> answer the pagans,
who objected the novelty of the Christian
religion: You should not look so much
(saith he) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quid reliquerimus</span></span> as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quid secuti
simus</span></span>; be rather satisfied with the good
which we follow, than to quarrel why we
have changed our former practise. He
giveth instance, that when men found the
art of weaving clothes, they did no longer
clothe themselves in skins; and when they
learned to build houses, they left off to
dwell in rocks and caves. All this carrieth
reason with it, for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">optimum est eligendum</span></span>.
If all this satisfy not, it may be Nazianzen's
rule<a id="noteref_1379" name="noteref_1379" href="#note_1379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1379</span></span></a> will move some man: When there was
a great stir about his archbishopric of Constantinople,
he yielded for peace; because
this storm was raised for his sake, he wished
to be cast into the sea. He often professeth
that he did not affect riches, nor dignities,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-017">[pg 6-017]</span><a name="Pg6-017" id="Pg6-017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but rather to be freed of his bishopric.
We are like to listen long before we hear
such expressions either from archbishop or
bishop in England, who seem not to care
much who sink, so that themselves swim
above. Yet I shall name one rule more,
which I shall take from the confessions of
two English prelates. One<a id="noteref_1380" name="noteref_1380" href="#note_1380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1380</span></span></a> of them hath
this contemplation upon Hezekiah's taking
away the brazen serpent, when he perceived
it to be superstitiously abused: <span class="tei tei-q">“Superstitious
use (saith he) can mar the very institutions
of God, how much more the most
wise and well-grounded devices of men?”</span>
Another<a id="noteref_1381" name="noteref_1381" href="#note_1381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1381</span></span></a> of them acknowledged that whatsoever
is taken up at the injunction of men,
and is not of God's own prescribing, when it
is drawn to superstition, cometh under the
case of the brazen serpent. You may easily
make the assumption, and then the conclusion,
concerning those ceremonies which are
not God's institutions but men's devices, and
have been grossly and notoriously abused by
many to superstition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now to return to the point in hand, if
upon all or any of these, or the like principles,
any of this kingdom shall join in the
removal of corruptions out of the church,
which yet they do not conceive to be in
themselves, and intrinsically corruptions in
religion, in this case I say with the Apostle,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
rejoice,”</span> Phil. i. 18, because every way reformation
is set forward. But let such an
one look to himself, how the doctrine drawn
from this text falleth upon him, that he who
only ceaseth to do evil, but repenteth not of
the evil,—he who applieth himself to reformation,
but is not ashamed of former defilements,
is in danger both of God's displeasure,
and of miscarrying in his judgment
about reformation. It is far from my meaning
to discourage any who are, with humble
and upright hearts, seeking after more light
than yet they have; I say it only for their
sake, who, through the presumption and unhumbledness
of their spirits, will acknowledge
no fault in anything they have formerly
done in church matters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot leave this application to the
kingdom till I enlarge it a little farther.
There are four considerations which may
make England ashamed and confounded before
the Lord.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-018">[pg 6-018]</span><a name="Pg6-018" id="Pg6-018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Because of the great blessings which
it hath so long wanted. Your flourishing
estate in the world could not have countervailed
the want of the purity and liberty of
the ordinances of Christ. That was a heavy
word of the Prophet, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now for a long season
Israel hath been without the true God,
and without a teaching priest, and without
law,”</span> 2 Chron. xv. 3. It hath not been
altogether so with this land, where the
Lord hath had not only a true church, but
many burning and shining lights, many gracious
preachers and professors, many notable
defenders of the Protestant cause against
Papists, many who have preached and written
worthily of practical divinity, and of
those things which most concern a man's
salvation. Nay, I am persuaded, that all
this time past, there have been in this kingdom
many thousands of his secret and sealed
ones, who have been groaning under that
burden and bondage which they could not
help, and have been <span class="tei tei-q">“waiting for the consolation
of Israel,”</span> Luke ii. 25. Nevertheless,
the reformation of the church of England
hath been exceedingly deficient, in government,
discipline and worship; yea, and
many places of the kingdom have been
<span class="tei tei-q">“without a teaching priest,”</span> and other
places poisoned with false teachers. It is
said (1 Sam. vii. 2), that all the house of
Israel lamented after the Lord, when they
wanted the ark twenty years. O let England
lament after the Lord, until the ark
be brought into the own place of it!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. There is another cause of this great
humiliation, and that is, the point in the
text, to be ashamed <span class="tei tei-q">“of all that you have
done.”</span> Sin, sin is that which blacketh our
faces, and covereth us with confusion as with
a mantle, and then most of all when we may
read our sin in some judgment of God which
lieth upon us; therefore the Septuagint
here, instead of being <span class="tei tei-q">“ashamed of all that
they have done,”</span> read—<span class="tei tei-q">“accept their punishment
for all that they have done,”</span> which
agreeth to that word in the law:<a id="noteref_1382" name="noteref_1382" href="#note_1382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1382</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If then
their uncircumcised hearts be humbled (the
Greek readeth there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ashamed</span></em>) and they then
accept of the punishment of their iniquity,”</span>
Lev. xxvi. 41. This is now England's case,
whose sin is written in the present judgment,
and graven in your calamity as <span class="tei tei-q">“with a pen
of iron, and with a point of a diamond”</span> (Jer.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-019">[pg 6-019]</span><a name="Pg6-019" id="Pg6-019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
xvii. 1), to make you say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord our
God is righteous in all his works which he
doeth: for we obeyed not his voice,”</span> Dan.
ix. 14. Did not the land make idol gods
of the court, and of the prelatical clergy,
and feared them, and followed them more
than God, and obeyed them rather than
God, so that their threshold was set by
God's threshold, and their posts by God's
posts? as it is said, ver. 7. I speak not now
of lawful obedience to authority. Is it not
a righteous thing with the Lord to make
these, your idols, his rods to correct you?
Hath not England harboured and entertained
Papists, priests, and Jesuits in its bosom?
Is it not just that now you feel the
sting and poison of these vipers? Hath
there not been a great compliance with the
prelates, for peace's sake, even to the prejudice
of truth? Doth not the Lord now
justly punish that Episcopal peace with an
Episcopal war? Was not that prelatical
government first devised, and since continued,
to preserve peace and to prevent
schisms in the church? And was it not
God's just judgment that such a remedy of
man's invention should rather increase than
cure the evil? So that sects have most multiplied
under that government, which now
you know by sad experience. Hath not
this nation, for a long time, taken the name
of the Lord in vain, by a formal worship
and empty profession? Is it not a just requital
upon God's part, that your enemies
have all this while taken God's name in
vain, and taken the Almighty to witness of
the integrity of their intentions for religion,
law and liberty, thus persuading the world
to believe a lie? What shall I say of the
book of sports, and other profanations of the
Lord's day? This licentiousness was most
acceptable to the greatest part, and they
<span class="tei tei-q">“loved to have it so,”</span> Jer. v. 31. Doth
not the great famine of the word almost
everywhere in the kingdom, except in this
city, make the land mourn on the Sabbath,
and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I do remember my faults this
day?”</span> Gen. xli. 9. Yea, doth not the land
now enjoy her Sabbaths, while men are constrained
not only to cease from sports on
that day, but from labouring the ground,
and from other works of their calling upon
other days? What should I speak of the
lusts and uncleanness, gluttony and drunkenness,
chambering and wantonness, prodigality
and lavishness, excess of riot, masking, and
balling, and sporting, when Germany and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-020">[pg 6-020]</span><a name="Pg6-020" id="Pg6-020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Palatinate, and other places, were wallowing
in blood, yea, when there was so
much sin and wrath upon this same kingdom?
Will not you say now, that for this
the Lord God hath caused your <span class="tei tei-q">“sun to go
down at noon,”</span> and hath turned your feasts
into mourning, and all your songs into lamentations?
(Amos viii. 9, 10.) Or what
should I say of the oppressions, injustice,
cozenage in trading and in merchandise,
which yourselves know better than I can do
how much they have abounded in the kingdom?
Doth not God now punish the secret
injustice of his people by the open injustice
of their enemies? Do ye not remember
that mischief was framed by a law?
And now, when your enemies execute mischief
against law, will you not say, Righteous
art thou, O Lord, and just are thy
judgments. One thing I may not forget,
and that is, that the Lord is punishing
blood with blood, the blood of the oppressed,
the blood of the persecuted, the blood of
those who have died in prisons, or in strange
countries, suffering for righteousness' sake.
He that departed from evil did even make
himself a prey, Isa. lix. 15. There was not
so much as one drop of blood spilt upon the
pillory for the testimony of the truth but
it crieth to heaven, for precious is the
blood of the saints, (Psal. lxxii. 14.) Doth
not all the blood shed in Queen Mary's
days cry? And doth not the blood of the
Palatinate and of Rochel cry? And doth
not the blood of souls cry? which is the
loudest cry of all. God said to Cain, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me
from the ground,”</span> Gen. iv. 10. The Hebrew
hath it, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy brother's blood,”</span> which
is well expounded both by the Chaldee Paraphrase
and the Jerusalem Targum, the voice
of the blood of all the generations and the
righteous people which thy brother should
have begotten crieth unto me. I may apply
it to the thing in hand: The silencing,
deposing, persecuting, imprisoning, and banishing
of so many of the Lord's witnesses,
of the most painful and powerful preachers,
and the preferring of so many either dumb
dogs or false teachers, maketh the voice of
bloods to cry to heaven, even the blood of
many thousands, yea, thousands of thousands
of souls, which have been lost by the one, or
might have been saved by the other. God
will require the blood of the children which
those righteous Abels might have begotten
unto him. There is, beside all this, more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-021">[pg 6-021]</span><a name="Pg6-021" id="Pg6-021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
blood-guiltiness, which is secret, but shall
sometime be brought to light. O blood!
blood! O let the land tremble, while the
righteous Judge makes <span class="tei tei-q">“inquisition for
blood,”</span> Psal. ix. 12; O let England cry,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God”</span>!
Psal. li. 14.

them. God gives not a charge to the destroying
angel (Ezek. ix. 4) to spare those
who have not been actors in the public sins
and abominations, but to spare those only
who cry and sigh for those abominations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, When the ministers of state,
or others having authority in church or
commonwealth, take the boldness to do such
acts, the kingdom is not blameless; for they
durst not have done as they did, had the
Lord but disclaimed, discountenanced, and
cried out against them. It is marked both
of John Baptist (Matt. xiv. 5), and of Christ
(Matt. xxi. 46), and of the apostles (Acts
iv. 21), that so long as the people did magnify
them, and esteem them highly, their
enemies durst not do unto them what else
they would have done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. A third consideration concerning the
kingdom is this. Notwithstanding of all
the happiness and gospel-blessings which it
hath wanted in so great a measure, and notwithstanding
of all the sins which have so
much abounded in it, yet the servants of
God have charged it with great presumption,<a id="noteref_1383" name="noteref_1383" href="#note_1383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1383</span></span></a>
that the church of England hath said
with the church of Laodicea, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am rich,
and increased with goods, and have need of
nothing,”</span> Rev. iii. 17. It hath been proud
of its clergy, learning, great revenues, peace,
plenty, wealth, and abundance of all things,
and as the Apostle chargeth the Corinthians,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are puffed up, and have not rather
mourned,”</span> that the wicked ones <span class="tei tei-q">“might be
taken away from among you,”</span> 1 Cor. v. 2.
And would God this presumption had taken
an end when God did begin to afflict the
land. It did even make an idol of this Parliament,
and trusted to its own strength and
armies, which hath provoked God so much,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-022">[pg 6-022]</span><a name="Pg6-022" id="Pg6-022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that he hath sometimes almost blasted your
hopes that way, and hath made you to feel
your weakness even where you thought yourselves
strongest. God would not have England
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mine own hand hath saved me,”</span>
Judg. vii. 2; neither will he have Scotland to
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“My hand hath done it:”</span> but he will
have both to say, His hand hath done it,
when we were lost in our own eyes. God
grant that your leaning so much upon the
arm of flesh be not the cause of more blows.
God must be seen in the work, and he will
have us to give him all the glory, and to say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou also hast wrought all our works in
us,”</span> Isa. xxvi. 12. O that all our presumption
may be repented of, and that the land
may be yet more deeply humbled! Assuredly
God will arise and subdue our enemies,
and command deliverances for Jacob;
but it is as certain God will not do this till
we be more humbled and (as the text saith)
ashamed of all that we have done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. There is another motive more evangelical:
Let England be humbled even
for the mercy, the most admirable mercy
which God hath showed upon so undeserving
and evil-deserving a kingdom. See it in
this same prophecy, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will establish my
covenant with thee; and thou shalt know
that I am the Lord: that thou mayest remember,
and be confounded, and never open
thy mouth any more because of thy shame,
when I am pacified toward thee for all that
thou hast done, saith the Lord God,”</span> Ezek.
xvi. 62, 63. And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not for your
sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it
known unto you: be ashamed and confounded
for your own ways, O house of Israel,”</span>
Ezek. xxxvi. 32; <span class="tei tei-q">“O my God (saith Ezra),
I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
to thee,”</span> Ezra. ix. 6. And what was it
that did so confound him? You may find
it in that which followeth: God had showed
them mercy, and had left them a remnant
to escape, and had given them a nail in his
holy place, and had lightened their eyes:
<span class="tei tei-q">“And now (saith he), O our God, what
shall we say after this? for we have forsaken
thy commandments,”</span> Ezra. ix. 10.
Let us this day compare, as he did, God's
goodness and our own guiltiness. England
deserved nothing but to get a bill of divorce,
and that God should have said in his wrath,
Away from me, I have no pleasure in you;
but now he hath received you into the bond
of his covenant, he rejoiceth over you to do
you good, and to dwell among you; his banner
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-023">[pg 6-023]</span><a name="Pg6-023" id="Pg6-023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
over you is love. O let our hard hearts
be overcome and be confounded with so
much mercy, and let us be ashamed of ourselves,
that after so much mercy we should
be yet in our sins and trespasses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a third application, which I intend
for the ministry, who ought to go before
the people of God in the example of
repentance and humiliation. You know the
old observation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Raro vidi clericum poenitentem</span></span>,—I
have seldom seen a clergyman
penitent. As Christ saith of rich men
(Mark x. 24, 25), I may say of learned
men, It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle, than for a man that
trusts in his learning to enter into the
kingdom of heaven. He will needs maintain
the lawfulness of all which he hath
done, and will not be, as this text would
have him, ashamed of all that he hath done.
Yet it is not impossible with God to make
such an one deny himself, and that whatsoever
in him exalts itself against Christ should
be brought into captivity to the obedience of
Christ (2 Cor. x. 5). Among all that were
converted by the ministry of the apostles, I
wonder most at the conversion of a great
company of priests, Acts vi. 7. I do not
suspect, as two learned men have
done,<a id="noteref_1384" name="noteref_1384" href="#note_1384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1384</span></span></a>
that the text is corrupted in that place, and
that it should be otherwise read. I am the
rather satisfied, because there is nothing
there mentioned of the conversion of the
high priest, or of the chief priests, the heads
of the twenty-four orders which were upon
the council, and had condemned Christ: the
place cannot be understood but of a multitude
of common or inferior priests, even as,
by proportion, in Hezekiah's reformation,
the Levites were more upright in heart
than the priests, 2 Chron. xxix. 34.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now many of the inferior clergy (as
they were abusively called) are more upright
in heart unto this present reformation
than any of those who had assumed to
themselves high degrees in the church. The
hardest point of all is, so to embrace and
follow reformation as to be ashamed of former
prevarications and pollutions. But in
this also the Holy Ghost hath set examples
before the ministers of the gospel. I read,
2 Chron. xxx. 15, <span class="tei tei-q">“The priests and the
Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves,
and brought in the burnt-offerings
into the house of the Lord.”</span> They thought
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-024">[pg 6-024]</span><a name="Pg6-024" id="Pg6-024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it not enough to be sanctified, but they were
ashamed that they had been before defiled.
A great prophet is not content to have his
judgment rectified which had been in error,
but he is ashamed of the error he had been
in; <span class="tei tei-q">“So foolish was I (saith he) and ignorant:
I was as a beast before thee,”</span> Psal.
lxxiii. 22. A great apostle must glorify
God, and humbly acknowledge his own
shame; <span class="tei tei-q">“For I am the least of the apostles
(saith he), that am not meet to be
called an apostle, because I persecuted the
church of God,”</span> 1 Cor. xv. 9. And shall I
add the example of a great father? Augustine
confesseth<a id="noteref_1385" name="noteref_1385" href="#note_1385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1385</span></span></a> honestly, that for the space
of nine years he both was deceived, and did
deceive others. Nature will whisper to a
man to look to his credit: but the text here
calleth for another thing,—to look to the
honour of God, and to thine own shame;
and yet in so doing thou shalt be more
highly esteemed both by God and by his
children. Now without this let a man seem
to turn and reform never so well, all is unsure
work, and built upon a sandy foundation.
And whosoever will not acknowledge
their iniquity, and be ashamed for it, God
shall make them bear their shame; according
to that which is pronounced in the next
chapter, ver. 10-15, against the Levites,
who had gone astray when Israel went
astray after their idols; and according to
that, Mal. ii. 8, 9, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye have corrupted
the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of
hosts: therefore have I also made you contemptible
and base before all the people.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourth and last application of this
doctrine is for every Christian. The text
teacheth us a difference betwixt a presumptuous
and a truly humbled sinner;
the one is ashamed of his sins, the other
not. By this mark let every one of us try
himself this day. It is a saving grace to be
truly and really ashamed of sin. It is one
of the promises of the covenant of grace,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then shall ye remember your own evil
ways, and your doings that were not good,
and shall loathe yourselves in your own
sight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations,”</span>
Ezek. xxxvi. 31. Try, then, if
thou hast but thus much of the work of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-025">[pg 6-025]</span><a name="Pg6-025" id="Pg6-025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grace in thy soul; and if thou hast, be assured
of thy interest in Christ and in the
new covenant. A reprobate may have somewhat
which is very like this grace: but I
shall lay open the difference betwixt the
one and the other in these particulars:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. To be truly ashamed of sin, is to be
ashamed of it as an act of filthiness and uncleanness.
The child of God, when he comes
to the throne of grace, is ashamed of an unclean
heart, though the world cannot see it.
A natural man, at his best, looketh upon sin
as it damneth and destroyeth the soul, but
he cannot look upon it as it defiles the soul.
Shame ariseth properly from a filthy act,
though no other evil be to follow upon it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. As we are ashamed of acts of filthiness,
so of acts of folly. A natural man may
judge himself a fool in regard of the circumstances
or consequents of his sin, but he is
not convinced that sin in itself is an act of
madness and folly. When the child of God
is humbled he becomes a fool in his own
eyes,—he perceives he had done like a mad
fool, 1 Cor. iii. 18; therefore he is said then
to come to himself, Luke xv. 17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The child of God is ashamed of sin
as an act of unkindness and unthankfulness
to a sweet merciful Lord, Psal. cxxx. 4;
Rom. ii. 4. Though there were no other
evil in sin, the conscience of so much mercy
and love so far abused, and so unkindly
recompensed, is that which confoundeth a
penitent sinner. As the wife of a kind husband,
if she play the whore (though the
world know it not), and if her husband,
when he might divorce her, shall still love
her and receive her into his bosom; such a
one, if she have at all any sense, or any
bowels of sorrow, must needs be swallowed
up of shame and confusion for her undutifulness
and treachery to such a husband.
But now the hypocrite is not at all troubled
or afflicted in spirit for sin as it is an act of
unkindness to God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Shame, as philosophers have defined
it,<a id="noteref_1386" name="noteref_1386" href="#note_1386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1386</span></span></a>
is <span class="tei tei-q">“the fear of a just reproof:”</span> not
simply the fear of a reproof, but the fear of
a just reproof. That is servile; this filial.
The child of God is ashamed of the very
guiltiness, and of that which may be justly
laid to his charge; the hypocrite not so.
Saul was not ashamed of his sin, but he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-026">[pg 6-026]</span><a name="Pg6-026" id="Pg6-026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was ashamed that Samuel should reprove
him before the elders of the people, 1
Sam. xv. 15, 30. Christ's adversaries were
ashamed (Luke xiii. 17), not of their error,
but because their mouths were stopped before
the people, and they could not answer
him. A hypocrite is ashamed, <span class="tei tei-q">“as a thief
is ashamed when he is found,”</span> Jer. ii. 26;
mark that, <span class="tei tei-q">“when he is found;”</span> a thief is
not ashamed of his sin, but because he is
found in it, and so brought to a shameful
end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. When the cause of God is in hand, a
true penitent is so ashamed of himself that
he fears the people of God shall be put to
shame for his sake, and that it shall go the
worse with them because of his vileness and
guiltiness. This made David pray, <span class="tei tei-q">“O God,
thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins
are not hid from thee. Let not them that
wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be
ashamed for my sake; let not those that
seek thee be confounded for my sake, O
God of Israel,”</span> Psal. lxix. 5, 6. The sorrow
and shame of a hypocrite (as all his
other seeming graces) are rooted in self-love,
not in the love of God: he hath not
this in all his thoughts, that he is a spot or
blemish in the body or church of Christ,
and therefore to be humbled, lest for his
sake God be displeased with his people;
lest such a vile and abominable sinner as he
is bring wrath and confusion upon others,
and make Israel turn their back before the
enemy. O happy soul that hath such
thoughts as these!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have now done with the first part of
the text, wherein I have been the larger,
because it most fitteth the work of the day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Show them the
form of the house,”</span> &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before I come to the doctrines which do
here arise, I shall first explain the particulars
mentioned in this part of the text, so
as they may agree to the spiritual temple
or church of Christ, which in the beginning
I proved to be here intended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, We find here the form and fashion
of a house; in which the parts are very
much diversified one from another. There
are, in a formed and fashioned house, doors,
windows, posts, lintels, &amp;c.; there is also a
multitude of common stones in the walls
of the house. Such a house is the visible
ministerial church of Christ, the parts
whereof are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">partes dissimilares</span></span>,—some
ministers and rulers; some eminent lights;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-027">[pg 6-027]</span><a name="Pg6-027" id="Pg6-027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
others of the ordinary rank of Christians,—that
make up the walls. If God hath
made one but a small pinning in the wall,
he hath reason to be content, and must not
say, Why am not I a post, or a corner-stone,
or a beam? Neither yet may any
corner-stone despise the stones in the wall,
and say, I have no need of you.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, The Prophet was here to show
them <span class="tei tei-q">“the goings out of the house, and the
comings in thereof.”</span> These are not the
same but different gates, it is plain: <span class="tei tei-q">“When
the people of the land shall come before the
Lord in the solemn feasts, he that entereth
in by the way of the north gate to worship,
shall go out by the way of the south gate,
&amp;c., he shall not return by the way of the
gate whereby he came in,”</span> Ezek. xlvi. 9.
And that not only to teach us order, and
the avoiding of confusion, occasioned by the
contrary tides of a multitude, but to tell us
farther, <span class="tei tei-q">“No man, having put his hand to
the plough, and looking back, is fit for the
kingdom of God,”</span> Luke ix. 62. We must
not go out of the church the way that we
came in (that were a door of defection), but
hold our faces forward till we go out by the
door of death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, The text hath twice <span class="tei tei-q">“all the
forms thereof,”</span> which I understand of the
outward forms and of the inward forms,
which two I find very much distinguished
by those who have written of the form and
structure of the temple. The church is exceedingly
beautified, even outwardly, with
the ordinances of Christ, but the inward
forms are the most glorious: <span class="tei tei-q">“For, behold,
the kingdom of God is within you,”</span> Luke
xvii. 21; and it <span class="tei tei-q">“cometh not with observation,”</span>
ver. 20; <span class="tei tei-q">“The king's daughter is all
glorious within;”</span> yet even <span class="tei tei-q">“her clothing is
of wrought gold,”</span> Psal. xlv. 13. When the
angel had made an end of measuring the
inner house (Ezek. xlii. 15), then he brought
forth Ezekiel by the east gate, which was
the chief gate by which the people commonly
entered, and measured the outer wall in the
last place. God's method is first to try the
heart and reins, then to give to a man according
to his works, Jer. xvii. 10. So should we
measure, by the reed of the sanctuary, first
the inner house of our hearts and minds,
and then to measure our outer walls, and
to judge of our profession and external performances.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, The Prophet is commanded to
write in their sight <span class="tei tei-q">“all the ordinances
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-028">[pg 6-028]</span><a name="Pg6-028" id="Pg6-028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thereof, and all the laws thereof;”</span> for the
church is a house not only in an architectonic,
but in an economic sense. It is Christ's
family governed by his own laws; and a temple
which hath in it <span class="tei tei-q">“them that worship,”</span>
Rev. xi. 1, it hath its own proper laws by
which it is ordered. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alioe sunt leges Coesarum,
alioe Christi</span></span> (saith Jerome<a id="noteref_1387" name="noteref_1387" href="#note_1387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1387</span></span></a>),—Caesar's
laws and Christ's laws are not the same,
but divers one from another. Schoolmen
say,<a id="noteref_1388" name="noteref_1388" href="#note_1388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1388</span></span></a>
that a law, properly so called, is both
illuminative and impulsive: illuminative, to
inform and direct the judgment; impulsive,
to move and apply the will to action. And
accordingly there are two names in this
text given to Christ's laws and institutions:
one<a id="noteref_1389" name="noteref_1389" href="#note_1389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1389</span></span></a>
which importeth the instruction and
information of our minds; another,<a id="noteref_1390" name="noteref_1390" href="#note_1390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1390</span></span></a> which
signifieth a deep imprinting or engraving
(and that is made upon our hearts and affections),
such as a pen of iron and other instruments
could make upon a stone. It is
not well when either of the two is wanting;
for the light of truth, without the engraving
of truth, may be extinguished; and the engraving
of truth, without the light of truth,
may be obliterate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these I shall pass, and only pitch
upon two doctrines which I shall draw from
this second part of the text: one concerning
the will of God's commandment, what
God requireth of Israel to do; another concerning
the will of God's decree, what he
hath purposed himself to do.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first is this: <span class="tei tei-q">“God will have Israel
to build and order his temple, not as shall
seem good in their eyes, but according to
his own pattern only which he sets before
them,”</span> which doth so evidently appear from
this very text, that it needeth no other
proof; for what else meaneth the showing
of such a pattern to be kept and followed by
his people? Other passages of this kind
there are which do more abundantly confirm
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Lord did prescribe to Noah both the
matter, and fashion, and measures of the
ark (Gen. vi. 14-16). To Moses he gave
a pattern of the tabernacle, of the ark, of the
mercy-seat, of the vail, of the curtains, of
the two altars, of the table and all the furniture
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-029">[pg 6-029]</span><a name="Pg6-029" id="Pg6-029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thereof, of the candlestick and all the
instruments thereof, &amp;c. And though Moses
was the greatest prophet that ever arose
in Israel, yet God would not leave any part
of the work to Moses' arbitrement, but
straitly commandeth him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Look that thou
make them after their pattern, which was
showed thee in the mount,”</span> Exod. xxv. 40.
When it came to the building of the first temple,
Solomon was not in that left to his own
wisdom, as great as it was, but David, the man
of God, gave him a perfect <span class="tei tei-q">“pattern of all
that he had by the Spirit,”</span> 1 Chron. xxviii.
11-13. The second temple was also built
<span class="tei tei-q">“according to the commandment of the God
of Israel”</span> (Ezra vi. 14), by Haggai and Zechariah.
And for the New Testament, Christ
our great Prophet, and only King and Lawgiver
of the church, hath revealed his will
to the apostles, and they to us, concerning
all his holy things; and we must hold us at
these unleavened and unmixed ordinances
which the apostles, from the Lord, delivered
to the churches: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will put upon you (saith
he himself) none other burden: but that
which ye have already hold fast till I come,”</span>
Rev. ii. 24, 25.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know the church must observe rules of
order and conveniency in the common circumstances
of times, places, and persons;
but these circumstances are none of our holy
things,—they are only prudential accommodations,
which are alike common to all human
societies, both civil and ecclesiastical,
wherein both are directed by the same light
of nature, the common rule to both in all
things of that kind, providing always that
the general rules of the word be observed:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do all to the glory of God,”</span> 1 Cor. x.
31; <span class="tei tei-q">“Let all things be done to edifying,”</span>
1 Cor. xiv. 26; <span class="tei tei-q">“It is good neither to eat
flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything
whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended,
or is made weak,”</span> Rom. xiv. 21;
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let every man be fully persuaded in his
own mind. To him that esteemeth anything
to be unclean, to him it is unclean,”</span>
Rom. xiv. 5, 14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The text giveth some clearing to this
point: There is here showed to the house
of Israel a pattern of the whole structure,
and of the least part thereof, and all the
measures thereof; yet no pattern is given
of the kind, or quantity, or magnificence of
the several stones, or of the instruments
of building. The reason is, because the former
is essential to a house, the latter accidental,<a id="noteref_1391" name="noteref_1391" href="#note_1391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1391</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-030">[pg 6-030]</span><a name="Pg6-030" id="Pg6-030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the former, if altered, make another
building; the latter, though altered,
the building is the same: therefore where
we have in the text <span class="tei tei-q">“the forms thereof,”</span>
the Septuagint read ὑποστασιν αὐτοῦ,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
substance thereof</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to clear it a little farther, I put two
characters upon those circumstances which
are not determined by the word of God,
but left to be ordered by the church as
shall be found most convenient. First, They
are not things sacred, nor proper to the
church, as hath been said. They are of the
same nature, they serve for the same end
and use, both in sacred and civil things;
for order and decency, the avoiding of confusion
and the like, are alike common to
church and commonwealth. Secondly, I
shall describe them as one of the prelates
hath done, who tells us,<a id="noteref_1392" name="noteref_1392" href="#note_1392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1392</span></span></a> that the things
which the Scripture hath left to the discretion
of the church are those things <span class="tei tei-q">“which
neither needed nor could be particularly
expressed. They needed not, because they
are so obvious; and they could not, both
because they are so numerous, and because
so changeable.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will not insist upon questions of this
kind, but will make a short application of
the doctrine unto you, honourable and beloved.
You may plainly see from what
hath been said, that neither kings, nor parliaments,
nor synods, nor any power on
earth, may impose or continue the least
ceremony upon the consciences of God's
people, which Christ hath not imposed;
therefore let neither antiquity, nor custom,
nor conveniency, nor prudential considerations,
nor show of holiness, nor any pretext
whatsoever, plead for the reservation of
any of your old ceremonies, which have no
warrant from the word of God. Much
might have been said for the high places
among the Jews, as I hinted in the beginning;
and much might have been said
by the Pharisees for their frequent washings
(Mark vii. 2, 3, 4, 7), which, as they
were ancient, and received by the traditions
of the elders, so they were used to teach
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-031">[pg 6-031]</span><a name="Pg6-031" id="Pg6-031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men purity, and to put them in mind of
holiness; neither was their washing contrary
to any commandment of God, except
you understand that commandment of not
adding to the word (Deut. iv. 2; xii. 32;
Prov. xxx. 6), which doth equally strike
against all ceremonies devised by man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A little leaven leaveneth the whole
lump,”</span> Gal. v. 9; and a little leak will endanger
the ship. Thieves will readily dig
through a house, how much more will they
enter if any postern be left open to them.
The wild beasts and boars of the forest will
attempt to break down the hedges of the
Lord's vineyard (Psal. lxxx. 13), how much
more if any breach be left in the hedges.
If, therefore, you would make a sure reformation,
make a perfect reformation, lest
Christ have this controversy with England,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless I have somewhat against
thee,”</span> Rev. ii. 4. And so much of our
duty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second doctrine concerneth God's
decree, and it is this: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is concluded in
the council of heaven, and God hath it in
the thoughts of his heart, to repair the
breaches of his house, and to build such a
temple to himself, as is shadowed forth in
this vision of Ezekiel.”</span> For the comparing
of this verse with ver. 7 in this same chapter,
and with chap. xxxvii. 26, 27, will easily
make it appear, that this showing of the
pattern, and all this measuring, was not
only in reference to Israel's duty, but to
God's gracious purpose towards Israel. According
to that, Zech. i. 16, <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore
thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem
with mercies: my house shall be
built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a
line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.”</span>
Now this vision cannot be said to
be fulfilled in Zorobabel's temple, as I
proved before, only here take notice that
the second destruction of the temple by
the Romans was worse than the first by
the Babylonians,—that desolation was repaired,
but this could never be repaired,
though the Jews did attempt the building
again of the temple,<a id="noteref_1393" name="noteref_1393" href="#note_1393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1393</span></span></a> first under Adrian the
emperor, and afterward under Julian the
apostate. The hand of God was seen
against them most terribly by fire from
heaven, and other signs of that kind; and
about the same time (to observe that by the
way) the famous Delphic temple was without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-032">[pg 6-032]</span><a name="Pg6-032" id="Pg6-032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man's hand, by fire and earthquake,
utterly destroyed and never built again,—to
tell the world that neither Judaism nor
paganism should prevail, but the kingdom
of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where then must we seek for the accomplishment
of Ezekiel's vision, I mean for the
new temple in which the Lord will dwell
for ever, and where his holy name shall be
no more polluted? Surely we must seek
for it in the days of the gospel, as hath been
before abundantly proved; but that the
thing may be the better understood, let us
take with us, at least, some few general observations
concerning this temple of Ezekiel,
as it representeth what should come to
pass in the church of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, there is but one temple, not
many, showed to him,—which is in part,
and shall be yet more fulfilled in the church
of the New Testament, according to that,
Zech. xiv. 8, <span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall be in that day,
that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem;”</span>
which is the same that we have,
Ezek. xlvii. 1. Then follows, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the
Lord shall be King over all the earth: in
that day shall there be one Lord, and his
name one.”</span> The like promise we find elsewhere:
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will give them one heart, and
one way,”</span> Jer. xxxii. 39; Ezek. xi. 19. It
is observed, that for this very end of uniformity,
the heathens also did erect temples,
that they might all worship the same
idol-god in the same manner. The plague
of the Christian church hitherto hath been
temple against temple, and altar against
altar, <span class="tei tei-q">“But thou, O Lord, how long?”</span>
Psal. vi. 3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, Ezekiel's temple and city are
very large and capacious, as I showed in the
beginning; and the city had three gates
looking toward each of the four quarters of
the world, Ezek. xlviii. 31-34: all this to
signify the spreading of the gospel into all
the earth; which is also signified by the
holy waters issuing from the threshold of
the temple, and rising so high that they
were waters to swim in, Ezek. xlvii. 1, 5.
God hath said to his church, <span class="tei tei-q">“Enlarge the
place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth
the curtains of thine habitations: spare not,
lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy
stakes: for thou shalt break forth on the
right hand and on the left,”</span> Isa. liv. 2, 3.
A great increase of the church there was
in the apostles' times, Col. i. 6; but a far
greater may be yet looked for, Rom. xi. 12.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-033">[pg 6-033]</span><a name="Pg6-033" id="Pg6-033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Though the enemy did come in like a
flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifted up a
standard against him, Isa. lix. 19; <span class="tei tei-q">“The
sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was driven
back,”</span> Psal. cxiv. 3. But when the gospel
cometh, <span class="tei tei-q">“like a noise of many waters”</span> (as
the Prophet calls it, ver. 2, signifying an
irresistible increase), it is in vain to build
bulwarks against it: God will even break
open <span class="tei tei-q">“the fountains of the great deep,”</span>
and open <span class="tei tei-q">“the windows of heaven”</span> (Gen.
vii. 11); and the gospel will prove a second
flood, which will overflow the whole earth,
though not to destroy it (as Noah's did),
but to make it glad; <span class="tei tei-q">“For the earth shall
be filled with the knowledge of the glory of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea,”</span>
Hab. ii. 14; Isa. xi. 9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, In this temple, beside the holy
of holies, were three courts:<a id="noteref_1394" name="noteref_1394" href="#note_1394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1394</span></span></a> the court of
the priests; the court of the people, commonly
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atrium Israelis</span></span>; and, without
both these, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atrium Gentium</span></span>, the court
of the heathen, so called, because the heathen,
as also many of those who were legally
unclean, might not only come unto the
mountain of the house of the Lord, but also
enter within the outer wall (mentioned Ezek.
xlii. 20), and so worship in that outer court,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">intermurale</span></span>; unto which did belong (as
we learn from Josephus<a id="noteref_1395" name="noteref_1395" href="#note_1395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1395</span></span></a>) the great east
porch, which kept the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Solomon's
porch</span></span>,—in which both Christ himself did
preach (John x. 23), and the apostles after
him (Acts v. 12); by which means the free
grace of the gospel was held forth even to
heathens, and publicans, and unclean persons,
who were not admitted into the court
of Israel,—there to communicate in all the
holy things: <span class="tei tei-q">“For the Son of man is come to
seek and to save that which was lost,”</span> Luke
xix. 10. This outer court of the temple is
meant when it is said that the Pharisees
brought a woman taken in adultery into
the temple, and set her before Christ, John
viii. 2, 3. Now all this will hold true
answerably of the spiritual temple; for,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>, As the uncircumcised and the unclean
were not admitted into the temple among
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-034">[pg 6-034]</span><a name="Pg6-034" id="Pg6-034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the children of Israel (Ezek. xliv. 9), so
all that live in the church of Christ are not
to be admitted promiscuously to every ordinance
of God, especially to the Lord's table,
but only those whose profession, knowledge
and conversation, after trial, shall be found
such as may make them capable thereof:
yet as heathens and unclean persons did
enter into the outer court, and there hear
Christ and his apostles, so there shall ever
be in the church a door of grace and hope
open to the greatest and vilest sinners who
shall seek after Christ, and <span class="tei tei-q">“ask the way
to Zion, with their faces thitherward,”</span> Jer.
i. 5. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>, There shall be also somewhat
answerable to the court of the children
of Israel: God can raise up even of the
stones children to Abraham (Matt. iii. 9);
he will not want a people to tread in the
courts of his house, and to inquire in his
temple. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thirdly</span></em>, And as in the typical
temple there was a court for the priests,
so hath the Lord promised to the church:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yet shall not thy teachers be removed
into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall
see thy teachers,”</span> Isa. xxx. 20; and again,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will give you pastors according to mine
heart, which shall feed you with knowledge
and understanding,”</span> Jer. iii. 15. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourthly</span></em>,
And as there was a secret and most holy
place, where the ark was, and the mercy-seat,
and where the glory of God dwelt, so
Christ hath his own <span class="tei tei-q">“hidden ones”</span> (Psal.
lxxxiii. 3), <span class="tei tei-q">“the children of the bride-chamber”</span>
(Matt. ix. 15), who, <span class="tei tei-q">“with open
face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same image,
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit
of the Lord,”</span> 2 Cor. iii. 18. There is also
a time coming when God will open the secrets
of his temple, and make the ark of his
testament to be seen otherwise than yet it
hath been; which shall be at the sounding
of the seventh trumpet, Rev. xi. 15, 19.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, The fourth thing wherein Ezekiel's
temple represented the church of
Christ is in regard of the great strength
thereof: it stood <span class="tei tei-q">“upon a very high mountain,”</span>
chap. xl. 2. The material temple
also in Jerusalem, as it is described by
Josephus, was a very strong and impregnable
place. Interpreters think that Cyrus
was jealous of the strength of the temple,
and for that cause gave order that it should
not be built above threescore cubits high,
whereas Solomon had built it sixscore cubits
high, Ezra vi. 3. The Romans afterwards,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-035">[pg 6-035]</span><a name="Pg6-035" id="Pg6-035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when they had subdued Judea, had a watchful
eye upon the temple, and placed a strong
garrison in the castle Antonia (which was
beside the temple), the commander whereof
was called <span class="tei tei-q">“the captain of the temple”</span>
(Acts iv. 1); and all this for fear of sedition
and rebellion among the Jews when
they came to the temple. Now the invisible
strength of the spiritual temple is clearly
held forth unto us by him who cannot
deceive us: <span class="tei tei-q">“Upon this rock,”</span> saith he
(meaning himself), <span class="tei tei-q">“I will build my church,
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it,”</span> Matt. xvi. 18. The princes and
powers of the world are more jealous than
they need of the church's strength; and
yet (which is a secret judgment of God)
they have not been afraid to suffer Babylon
to be built in her full strength: <span class="tei tei-q">“There
were they in great fear where no fear was”</span>
(Psal. liii. 5); for when all shall come to
all, it shall be found that the gospel and
true religion is the strongest bulwark, and
chief strength for the safety and stability of
kings and states.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, The glory of this temple was very
great, insomuch that some have undertaken
to demonstrate<a id="noteref_1396" name="noteref_1396" href="#note_1396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1396</span></span></a> that it was a more glorious
piece than any of the seven miracles of the
world, which were so much spoken of among
the ancients. But the greatest glory of this
temple was, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the glory of the God of
Israel”</span> came into it, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the earth shined
with his glory,”</span> ver. 2; Christ, the brightness
of his Father's glory (Heb. i. 3), walking
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks
(Rev. i. 13), is and shall be more
and more the church's glory; therefore it
is said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, shine, for thy light
is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen
upon thee,”</span> Isa. lx. 1. Surely as it was
said of the new material temple, in reference
to Christ, so it may be said of the new
spiritual temple, which yet we look for,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The glory of this latter house shall be
greater than of the former, saith the Lord
of hosts; and in this place will I give peace,
saith the Lord of hosts,”</span> Hag. ii. 9. Christ
will keep the best wine till the end of the
feast (John ii. 10); and he will bless our
latter end more than our beginning, Ezek.
xxxvi. 11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That which I have said, from grounds of
Scripture, concerning a more glorious, yea,
more peaceable condition of the church to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-036">[pg 6-036]</span><a name="Pg6-036" id="Pg6-036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be yet looked for, is acknowledged by some
of our sound and learned writers<a id="noteref_1397" name="noteref_1397" href="#note_1397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1397</span></span></a> who have
had occasion to express their judgment about
it: and it hath no affinity with the opinion
of an earthly or temporal kingdom of Christ,
or of the Jews' building again of Jerusalem
and the material temple, and their obtaining
a dominion above all other nations, or
the like.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall now bring home the point. There
are very good grounds of hope to make us
think that this new temple is not far off;
and (for your part) that Christ is to make a
new face of a church in this kingdom,—a
fair and beautiful temple for his glory to
dwell in: and he is even now about the
work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, first, <span class="tei tei-q">“The set time”</span> to build Zion
is come, when the people of God <span class="tei tei-q">“take
pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust
thereof,”</span> Psal. cii. 13, 14, 16. The stones
which the builders of Babel refused are now
chosen for corner stones, and the stones which
they chose do the builders of Zion now refuse:
<span class="tei tei-q">“They shall not take of thee a stone
for a corner, nor a stone for foundations,”</span>
Jer. li. 26. Those that have anything of
Christ and of the image of God in them
begin to creep out of the dust of contempt,
and to appear like stars of the morning.
Nay, to go farther than that, the old stones,
the Jews, who have been for so many ages
lying forgotten in the dust, those poor <span class="tei tei-q">“outcasts
of Israel”</span> (Psal. cxlvii. 2), have of late
come more into remembrance, and have
been more thought of, and more prayed
for, than they were in former generations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, Are there not great preparations
and instruments fitted for the work?
Hath not God called together, for such a
time as this, the present Parliament, and
the Assembly of Divines, his Zorobabels,
and Jehoshuas, and Haggais, and Zechariahs?
Are there not also hewers of stones,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-037">[pg 6-037]</span><a name="Pg6-037" id="Pg6-037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and bearers of burdens? much wholesome
preaching, much praying and fasting, many
petitions put up both to God and man?
the covenant also going through the kingdom
as the chief preparation of materials
for the work? Is not the old rubbish of
ceremonies daily more and more shovelled
away, that there may be a clean ground?
and is not the Lord by all this affliction
humbling you, that there may be a deep
and a sure foundation laid?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, The work is begun, and shall it
not be finished? God hath laid the foundation,
and shall he not <span class="tei tei-q">“bring forth the
head-stone?”</span> Zech. iv. 7, 9. Christ hath
put Antichrist from his outerworks in Scotland,
and he is now come to put him from
his innerworks in England: <span class="tei tei-q">“His work is
perfect”</span> (Deut. xxxii. 4), saith Moses; <span class="tei tei-q">“I
am Alpha and Omega (saith Christ), the
beginning and the ending,”</span> Rev. i. 8;
<span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause
to bring forth, saith the Lord? shall I cause
to bring forth, and shut the womb, saith thy
God?”</span> Isa. lxvi. 9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I may add three other signs whereby to
discern the time, from Rev. xi. 1, the place
before cited: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>, Is there not now a
measuring of the temple, ordinances and
worshippers, by <span class="tei tei-q">“a reed like unto a rod?”</span>
The reed of the sanctuary in the Assembly's
hand, and the rod of power and law in your
hand, are well met together. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>,
There is a court, which before seemed to
belong to the temple, left out and not measured:
<span class="tei tei-q">“From him that hath not shall be
taken away even that which he hath,”</span> Matt.
xxv. 29. The Samaritans of this time, who
serve the Lord, and serve their own gods
too (2 Kings xvii. 33, 34), and do after the
manners of idolaters, have professed (as they
of old to the Jews, Ezra iv. 2), that they
would build with you; that they will be for
the true Protestant religion as you are; that
they will also consent to the reformation of
abuses, for the ease of tender consciences.
But God doth so alienate and separate betwixt
you and them, by his overruling providence,
discovering their designs against
you, and their deep engagements to the
popish party, as if he would say unto them,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial
in Jerusalem,”</span> Neh. ii. 20; or as it
is in the parable concerning those who had
refused to come when they were invited,
yea, had taken the servants of Christ and
entreated them spitefully, and killed them,—the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-038">[pg 6-038]</span><a name="Pg6-038" id="Pg6-038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
great king hath said in his wrath, that
they shall not taste of his supper, and he
sends forth his armies to destroy those murderers,
and to burn up their city, Matt. xxii.
6, 7; Luke xiv. 24. Surely what they have
professed<a id="noteref_1398" name="noteref_1398" href="#note_1398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1398</span></span></a> concerning reformation is scarce
so much as the Pope did acknowledge when
reformation did begin in Germany. However,
as it is our heart's desire and prayer
to God for them that they may be saved,
so we are not out of hopes that God hath
many of his own among them, unto whom
he will give <span class="tei tei-q">“repentance to the acknowledging
of the truth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, The time seemeth to answer fitly:
The new temple is built when the forty-two
months of the beast's reign, and of the treading
down the holy city (that is, by the best
interpretation, twelve hundred and sixty
years) come to an end. This computation,
I conceive, should begin rather before the
four hundredth year of Christ than after it;
both because the Roman Emperor (whose
falling was the Pope's rising) was brought
very low before that time by the wars of
the Goths and other barbarous nations,
and otherwise, which will appear from history;
and further, because pope Innocentius<a id="noteref_1399" name="noteref_1399" href="#note_1399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1399</span></span></a>
(who succeeded about the year 401)
was raised so high that he drew all appeals
from other bishops to the apostolical see,
according to former statutes and customs,
as he saith. I cannot pitch upon a likelier
time than the year 383, at which time (according
to the common calculation) a general
Council at Constantinople (though Baronius
and some others reckon that Council in
the year 381) did acknowledge the primacy
of the bishop of Rome,<a id="noteref_1400" name="noteref_1400" href="#note_1400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1400</span></span></a> only reserving to
the bishop of Constantinople the second
place among the bishops. Did not then
the beast receive much power when this
much was acknowledged by a council of one
hundred and fifty bishops, though sitting in
the East, and moderated by Nectarius, archbishop
of Constantinople. Immediately after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-039">[pg 6-039]</span><a name="Pg6-039" id="Pg6-039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this council, it is acknowledged by one of
our great antiquaries,<a id="noteref_1401" name="noteref_1401" href="#note_1401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1401</span></span></a> that the bishop of
Rome did labour mightily to draw all causes
to his own consistory, and that he doth
scarce read of any heretic or schismatic condemned
in the province where he lived, but
straight he had recourse to the bishop of
Rome. Another of our antiquaries<a id="noteref_1402" name="noteref_1402" href="#note_1402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1402</span></span></a> noteth
not long before that Council, that Antichrist
did then begin to appear at Rome,
and to exalt himself over all other bishops.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now if we should reckon the beginning
of the beast's reign about the time of that
Council, the end of it will fall in at this
very time of ours. But I dare not determine
so high a point. God's work will, ere
it be long, make a clearer commentary upon
his word. Only let this be remembered,
We must not think it strange if, after the
end of the twelve hundred and sixty years,
Antichrist be not immediately and utterly
abolished; for when that time is ended he
makes war against the witnesses, yea, overcometh
and killeth them. But that victory
of his lasteth only three days and a half,
and then God makes, as it were, a resurrection
from the dead, and a tenth part of
the great city falls before the whole fall;
see Rev. xi. 3, 7, 11, 13. Whether this
killing of the witnesses (which seemeth to
be the last act of Antichrist's power) be
past, or to come, I cannot say: God knows.
But assuredly, the acceptable year of Israel's
jubilee, and the day of vengeance
upon Antichrist, is coming, and is not far
off.

But now, is there no other application
to be made of this point? Is all this said to
satisfy curious wits, or, at the best, to comfort
the people of God? Nay, there is
more than so: it must be brought home to
a practical use. As the assurance of salvation
doth not make the child of God the
more presumptuous, but the more humble
(Ezek. xvi. 63); neither doth it make him
negligent, but diligent in the way of holiness,
and in all the acts of his spiritual
warfare, Phil. iii. 13, 14; 2 Pet. i. 10;
so that <span class="tei tei-q">“every man that hath this hope
in him purifieth himself,”</span> 1 John iii. 3: so
answerably, the assurance of the new temple,
and of the sweet days to come, serveth
for a twofold practical use; even as David
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-040">[pg 6-040]</span><a name="Pg6-040" id="Pg6-040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also applieth God's promise of Solomon's
building the temple, 1 Chron. xxii. 9; for
thus he speaketh to the princes of Israel,
ver. 19, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now set your heart and your
soul to seek the Lord your God; arise,
therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the
Lord God;”</span> and this is, beside, the charge
which he giveth to Solomon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, then, ye must set your heart and
your soul to seek God, forasmuch as you
know it is not in vain to seek him for this
thing, Dan. ix. 2, 3. When Daniel understood
by books that the seventy years of
Jerusalem's desolation were at an end, and
that the time of building the temple again
was at hand, then he saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“I set my face
unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth,
and ashes.”</span> O let us do as he did! O let
us <span class="tei tei-q">“cry mightily unto God,”</span> Jonah iii. 8;
and let us, with all our soul, and all our
might, give ourselves to fasting and prayer.
Now, if ever, <span class="tei tei-q">“the effectual fervent prayer
of a righteous man availeth much,”</span> James
v. 16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, And the more actively you must
go about the business. <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
always abounding in the work of
the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labour is not in vain in the Lord,”</span> 1 Cor.
xv. 58. What greater motive to action than
to know that you shall prosper in it? <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise
therefore, and be doing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And so I am led upon the third and last
part of the text, of which I shall speak but
very little.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine is this: Reformation ends
not in contemplation, but in action. The
pattern of the house of God is set before us
to the end it may be followed; and the
ordinances thereof to the end they may be
obeyed: <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me understanding (saith
David), and I shall keep thy law; yea, I
shall observe it with my whole heart,”</span> Psal.
cxix. 34; <span class="tei tei-q">“If ye know these things (saith
Christ), happy are ye if ye do them,”</span> John
xiii. 17. The point is plain, and needeth
no proof but application.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let me therefore, honourable worthies,
leave in your bosoms this one point more:
Many of the servants of God who have
stood in this place, and could do it better
than I can, have been calling upon you to go
on in the work of reformation: O <span class="tei tei-q">“be not
slothful in business,”</span> Rom. xii. 11; and
forget not to do as you have been taught.
Had you begun at this work, and gone
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-041">[pg 6-041]</span><a name="Pg6-041" id="Pg6-041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about the building of the house of God as
your first and chief business, I dare say
you should have prospered better. It was
one cause, among others, why the children
of Israel (though the greater number, and
having the better cause too) did twice fall
before Benjamin, because, while they made
so great a business for the villainy committed
upon the Levites' concubine, they had
taken no course with the graven image of
the children of Dan (Jud. xviii. 30, 31), a
thing which did more immediately touch
God in his honour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I am confident errors of this kind
will be now amended, and that you will, by
double diligence, redeem the time. I know
your trouble is great, and your cares many,
in managing the war, and looking to the
safety of the kingdom, yet mark what David
did in such a case: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, in my
trouble (saith he) I have prepared for the
house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents
of gold, and a thousand thousand talents
of silver; and of brass and iron without
weight,”</span> 1 Chron. xxii. 14. David did
manage great wars with mighty enemies,
(2 Sam. v., viii., x., xi.,) the Philistines,
Moabites, Ammonites, and Syrians; beside
the intestine war made first by Abner
(2 Sam. ii. 8), and afterward by Absalom
(2 Sam. xv. 10), and after that by Sheba
(2 Sam. xx. 1.) Notwithstanding of all
this, in his trouble and poverty (the word
signifieth both), he made this great preparation
for the house of God; and if God
had given him leave, he had, in his trouble,
built it too, for you well know he was not
hindered from building the temple by the
wars or any other business, but only because
God would not permit him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Set before you also the example of the
Jews, when the prophets of God did stir
them up to the building of the temple, Ezra
v. 1, 2. They say not, We must first build
the walls of Jerusalem to hold out the enemy,
but the text saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“They began to
build the house of God.”</span> They were not
full four years in building the temple, and
finished it in the sixth year of Darius,
Ezra. iv. 24 with vi. 15. Now all the rest
of his reign did pass, and all Xerxes' reign,
and much of Artaxerxes Longimanus's
reign, before the walls of Jerusalem were
built, for about that work was Nehemiah
from the twentieth year of Artaxerxes to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6-042">[pg 6-042]</span><a name="Pg6-042" id="Pg6-042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
two and thirtieth year (Neh. v. 14); and if
great chronologers be not very far mistaken,
the temple was finished fourscore and three
years before the walls of Jerusalem were
finished.<a id="noteref_1403" name="noteref_1403" href="#note_1403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1403</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is far from my meaning to cool your
affection to the laws, liberties, peace, and
safety of the kingdom. I desire only to
warm your hearts with the zeal of reformation,
as that which, all along, you must
carry on in the first place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One thing I cannot but mention: The
reverend Assembly of Divines may lament
(as Augustine in another case), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heu, heu,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But since now, by the blessing of God,
they are thus far advanced, that they have
found, in the word of God, a pattern for
presbyterial government over many particular
congregations; and have found also, from
the word, that ordination is an act belonging
to such a presbytery, I beseech you improve
that <span class="tei tei-q">“whereto we have already attained”</span>
(Phil. iii. 16), till other acts of a presbytery
be agreed on afterward. Yourselves
know better than I do, that much people
is perishing (Prov. xxix. 18), because
there is no vision: <span class="tei tei-q">“The harvest truly is
great, but the labourers are few,”</span> Luke x.
2, Give me leave, therefore, to quicken
you to this part of the work, that, with all
diligence and without delay, some presbyteries
be associated and erected (in such
places as yourselves in your wisdom shall
judge fittest), with power to ordain ministers
with the consent of the congregations,
and after trial of the gifts, soundness and
conversation of the men. In so doing you
shall both please God and bring upon yourselves
the blessing of many poor souls that
are ready to perish (Job xxix. 13); and
you shall likewise greatly strengthen the
hearts and hands of your brethren in Scotland,
joined in covenant and in arms with
you. I say therefore again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise therefore,
and be doing, and the Lord be with
thee,”</span> 1 Chron. xxii. 16; yea, the Lord is
with you (Hag. ii. 4, 5) according to the
word that he hath covenanted with you, so
his Spirit remaineth among you: Fear ye
not, but <span class="tei tei-q">“be strong in the Lord, and in the
power of his might.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have in this sermon applied my thoughts toward
these three things: 1. The soul-ensnaring
error of the greatest part of men, who choose to
themselves such a way to the kingdom of heaven as
is broad, and smooth, and easy, and but little or nothing
at all displeasing to flesh and blood, like
him that tumbled down upon the grass and said,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Utinam hoc esset laborare</span></span>. 2. The grumbling and
unwillingness which appeareth in very many, when
they should submit to that reformation of the
church which is according to the mind of Jesus
Christ, like them that said to the seers, <span class="tei tei-q">“See not;
and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right
things, speak unto us smooth things,”</span> Isa. xxx, 10;
and again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us break their bands asunder,
and cast away their cords from us,”</span> Psal. ii. 3. 3.
The sad and desolate condition of the kingdom of
Scotland, then calling for our prayers and tears,
and saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Call me not Naomi (pleasant), call me
Mara (bitter): for the Almighty hath dealt very
bitterly with me,”</span> Ruth i. 20. We were <span class="tei tei-q">“pressed
out of measure, above strength,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“had the sentence
of death in ourselves, that we should not trust
in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead; who
delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver;
in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us,”</span> 2 Cor.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-iii">[pg 7-iii]</span><a name="Pg7-iii" id="Pg7-iii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
i. 8-10. Our brethren also <span class="tei tei-q">“helping together by
prayer for us,”</span> that for the mercy bestowed on us
by means of the prayers of many, thanks may be
given by many on our behalf. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord liveth,
and blessed be my Rock: and let the God of my salvation
be exalted,”</span> Psal. xviii, 46; He is our God;
and we will prepare for him an habitation; our father's
God, and we will exalt him, Exod. xv. 2;
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who
only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious
name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled
with his glory,”</span> Psal. lxxii. 18, 19. Scotland
shall yet be <span class="tei tei-q">“a crown of glory in the hand of the
Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God,”</span>
Isa. lxii. 3; and shall be called Hephzi-bah and Beulah.
Only let us remember our evil ways, and be
confounded, and never open our mouth any more
because of our shame, when the Lord our God is
pacified towards us. Now are both kingdoms put to
a trial, whether their humiliations be filial, and whether
then can mourn for sin more than for judgment.
And let us now hear what the Spirit speaketh
to the churches, and not turn again to folly
New provocations, or the old unrepented, will create
new ones; therefore <span class="tei tei-q">“sin no more, lest a worse
thing come unto us.”</span>

MALACHI iii. 2.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">But who may abide the day of his coming? and
who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is
like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If you ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“Of whom speaketh the
Prophet this, of himself or of some other
man?”</span> (Acts viii. 34)—it is answered, both
by Christian and Jewish interpreters: The
Prophet speaketh this of Christ, the Messenger
of the covenant, then much longed
and looked for by the people of God, as is
manifest by the preceding verse. And as
it was fit that Malachi, the last of the prophets,
should shut up the Old Testament
with clear promises of the coming of Christ
(which you find in this and in the following
chapter), so he takes the rather occasion
from the corrupt and degenerate estate of
the priests at that time (which he had mentioned
in the former chapter) to hold forth
unto the church the promised Messiah, who
was to come unto them to purify the sons of
Levi.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if you ask again, Of what coming or
appearing of Christ doth the Prophet speak
this? whether of the first, or of the last, or
of any other?—the answer of expositors is
not so unanimous. Some understand the
last coming of Christ, in the glory of his
Father, and holy angels, to judge the quick
and the dead. This cannot stand with ver.
34, <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall purify the sons of Levi, and
purge them,”</span> &amp;c.; but at the last judgment
it will be too late for the sons of Levi
to be purified and purged, or for Judah
and Jerusalem to bring offerings unto the
Lord, as in the days of old.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-002">[pg 7-002]</span><a name="Pg7-002" id="Pg7-002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Others understand the first coming of
Christ. And of these some understand his
incarnation, or appearing in the flesh; others
take the meaning to be of his coming into
the temple of Jerusalem, to drive out the
buyers and sellers (Matt. xxi. 10-12), at
which time all the city was moved at his
coming. This exposition hath better grounds
than the other, because the coming of Christ
(here spoken of) did not precede, but soon
follow after the ministry of John Baptist,
and therefore cannot be meant of our Saviour's
incarnation, but rather of his appearing
with power and authority in the temple.
But this also falleth short, and neither expresseth
the whole nor the principal part
of what is meant in this text; for how can
it be said that the prophecy which followeth,
ver. 3, 4 (which is all of a piece with
ver. 2), was fulfilled during Christ's appearing
and sitting in the temple of Jerusalem?
or how can it be conceived that the offerings
of Judah and Jerusalem were pleasant
to the Lord at that time, when the Gentiles
were not, and the Jews would not be
brought in, to offer unto the Lord an offering
in righteousness? So that whether we
understand by Judah and Jerusalem the
Jewish church or the Christian, this thing
could not be said to be accomplished while
Christ was yet upon earth. And in like
manner, whether we understand by the sons
of Levi the priests and Levites of the Jews,
or the ministers of the gospel, it cannot be
said that Christ did, in the days of his flesh,
purify the sons of Levi as gold and silver.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I deny not but the Lord Jesus did then
begin to set about this work. But that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-003">[pg 7-003]</span><a name="Pg7-003" id="Pg7-003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which is more principally here intended, is
Christ's coming and appearing in a spiritual,
but yet most powerful and glorious
manner, to erect his kingdom, and to gather
and govern his churches, by the ministry
of his apostles and other ministers, whom
he sent forth after his ascension.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of this coming he himself speaketh, Matt.
xvi. 28, <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily I say unto you, There be
some standing here which shall not taste of
death till they see the Son of man coming
in his kingdom;”</span> Mark addeth, <span class="tei tei-q">“with
power”</span> (Mark ix. 1). Neither was that all.
He did not so come at that time as to put
forth all his power, or to do his whole
work. He hath at divers times come and
manifested himself to his churches; and
this present time is a time of the revelation
of the Son of God, and a day of his
coming. We look also for a more glorious
coming of Jesus Christ before the end be:
for <span class="tei tei-q">“the Redeemer shall come to Sion”</span>
(Isa. lix. 20), <span class="tei tei-q">“and shall turn away ungodliness
from Jacob”</span> (Rom. xi. 26); and he
shall destroy Antichrist <span class="tei tei-q">“with the brightness
of his coming,”</span> 2 Thess. ii. 8; in which
place the Apostle hath respect to Isa. xi.
4, where it is said of Christ, the rod of
Jesse, <span class="tei tei-q">“with the breath of his lips shall he
slay the wicked.”</span> There, withal, you have
the church's tranquillity, the filling of the
earth with the knowledge of the Lord, and
the restoring of the dispersed Jews, as you
may read in that chapter. Some have
observed<a id="noteref_1404" name="noteref_1404" href="#note_1404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1404</span></span></a>
(which ought not to pass without
observation) that the Chaldee Paraphrase
had there added the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Romilus</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“He
shall slay the wicked Romilus;”</span> whereupon
they challenge Arias Montanus for leaving
out that word to wipe off the reproach from
the Pope. However, the Scriptures teach
us, that the Lord Jesus will be revealed
mightily, and will make bare his holy arm,
as well in the confusion of Antichrist, as
in the conversion of the Jews, before the
last judgment and the end of all things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By this time you may understand what
is meant in the text by the day of Christ's
coming, or εἰσοδου,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">coming in</span></span>, as the
Septuagint read, meaning his coming, or
entering into his temple, mentioned in the
first verse; by which temple Jerome upon
the place rightly understandeth the church,
or spiritual temple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When this temple is built, Christ cometh
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-004">[pg 7-004]</span><a name="Pg7-004" id="Pg7-004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into it, to fill the house with the cloud of his
glory, and to walk in the midst of the seven
golden candlesticks. The same thing is
meant by his appearing: <span class="tei tei-q">“When he appeareth,”</span>
saith our translation; <span class="tei tei-q">“When he shall
be revealed,”</span>;
others read, <span class="tei tei-q">“When he shall be seen,”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“in seeing of him.”</span> The original word I
find used to express more remarkable, divine,
and glorious sights, as Gen. xvi. 13,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Have I also here looked after him that
seeth me?”</span> xxii. 14, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the mount of the
Lord it shall be seen.”</span> From this word had
the prophets the name of seers, 1 Sam. ix.
9; and from the same word came the name
of visions, 2 Chron. xxvi. 5, <span class="tei tei-q">“Zechariah, who
had understanding in the visions of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, but what of all this? might some
think. If Christ come, it is well,—he is
the desire of all nations. O but when
Christ thus cometh into his kingdom among
men with power, and is seen appearing
with some beams of his glory, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who may
abide, and who shall stand?”</span> saith the text.
How shall sinners stand before the Holy
One? How shall dust and ashes have any
fellowship with the God of glory? How
shall our weak eyes behold the Sun of righteousness
coming forth like a bridegroom out
of his chamber? Did not Ezekiel fall upon
his face at <span class="tei tei-q">“the appearance of the likeness
of the glory of the Lord”</span>? Ezek. i. 28.
Did not Isaiah cry out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe is me, for I
am undone,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“for mine eyes have seen the
King, the Lord of hosts”</span>? Isa. vi. 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But why is it so hard a thing to abide the
day of Christ's coming, or to stand before
him when he appeareth in his temple? If
you ask of him, as Joshua did, <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou
for us, or for our adversaries?”</span> (Josh. v. 13,)
he will answer you, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay; but as a captain
of the host of the Lord am I now come,”</span>
(ver. 14.) If you ask of him, as the elders
of Bethlehem asked of Samuel (while they
were trembling at his coming), <span class="tei tei-q">“Comest
thou peaceably?”</span> He will answer you as
Samuel did, <span class="tei tei-q">“Peaceably.”</span> What is there
here, then, to trouble us? Doth he not
come to save, and not to destroy? Yes, to
save the spirit, but to destroy the flesh; he
will have the heart-blood of sin, that the
soul may live for ever. This is set forth by
a double metaphor: one taken from the
refiner's fire, which purifieth metals from
the dross; the other, from the fuller's soap;
others read the fuller's grass, or the fuller's
herb. Some have thought it so hard to determine,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-005">[pg 7-005]</span><a name="Pg7-005" id="Pg7-005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that they have kept into the translation
the very Hebrew word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">borith</span></span>. Jerome
tells us,<a id="noteref_1405" name="noteref_1405" href="#note_1405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1405</span></span></a> that the fuller's herb which
grew in the marsh places of Palestina, had
the same virtue for washing and making
white which nitre hath. Yet I suppose the
fuller's soap hath more of that virtue in it
than the herb could have. However it is
certain that ברר,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">borith</span></span>, cometh from a
word which signifieth to make clean, according
to that, Mark ix. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“His raiment became
shining, exceeding white as snow; so
as no fuller on earth can white them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to whom will Christ thus reveal himself?
And who are they whom he will refine
from their dross, and wash from their
filthiness? That we may know from the
two following verses: He is not a refiner's
fire to those that are <span class="tei tei-q">“reprobate silver,”</span>
(Jer. vi. 30,) and can never be refined;
neither is he as fuller's soap to those whose
spot <span class="tei tei-q">“is not the spot of his children”</span> (Deut.
xxxii. 5): nay, Christ doth not thus lose
his labour, but he refineth and maketh
clean the sons of Levi, also Judah and Jerusalem.
This, I doubt not to aver, doth
principally belong to the Jews, for to them
pertain the promises (Rom. ix. 4), saith the
Apostle, and the natural branches shall be
graffed into their own olive-tree (xi. 24); but
it belongeth also to us Gentiles, who are cut
out of the wild olive-tree, and are graffed
into the good olive-tree. God hath persuaded
Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem;
and so we are now the Judah and Jerusalem,
and our ministers the sons of Levi.
God's own church and people, even the best
of them, have need of this refiner's fire and
of this fuller's soap.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And so much for the scope, sense, and
coherence of the text. The general doctrine
which offereth itself to us from the
words, is this:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The way of Christ, and fellowship with
him, is very difficult and displeasing to our
sinful nature, and is not so easy a matter
as most men imagine.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, this doth clearly arise out
of the text. As when the people said to
Joshua, <span class="tei tei-q">“God forbid that we should forsake
the Lord, to serve other gods,”</span> (Josh.
xxiv. 16,) Joshua answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye cannot
serve the Lord, for he is an holy God; he
is a jealous God,”</span> (ver. 19.) Just so doth
the Prophet here answer the Jews, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-006">[pg 7-006]</span><a name="Pg7-006" id="Pg7-006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they were very much desiring and longing
for the Messiah, promising to themselves
comfort, and peace, and prosperity, and the
restoring of all things according to their
heart's desire, if Christ were once come.
Nay, saith the Prophet, not so: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who may
abide the day of his coming, and who shall
stand when he appeareth?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, Other scriptures do abundantly
confirm it: The doctrine of Jesus Christ
was such as made many of his disciples say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is an hard saying; who can hear it?”</span>
John vi. 60. And from that time many
of them <span class="tei tei-q">“went back, and walked no more
with him.”</span> A young man, a ruler, who came
to him with great affection, was so cooled and
discouraged at hearing of the cross, and selling
of all he had, that he went away sad and
sorrowful, Mark x. 21, 22. The apostles
themselves having heard him say, that <span class="tei tei-q">“it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
the kingdom of God,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“they were exceedingly
amazed [at this doctrine], saying,
Who then can be saved?”</span> Matt. xix. 24,
25. As for his life and actions, they were
such that not only did the Gadarenes beseech
him to depart out of their coasts
(Matt. viii. 34), but his own friends and
kinsfolks were about <span class="tei tei-q">“to lay hold on him:
for they said, He is beside himself,”</span> Mark
iii. 21. His sufferings were such, that all
his disciples did forsake him, and went away
every man to his own home again. And
what shall be the condition of those that will
follow him? If we will indeed be his disciples,
he hath forewarned us to sit down
first, and count our cost, Luke xiv. 28. He
hath told us, It will cost us no less than the
bearing of the cross, the forsaking of all,
yea, which is hardest of all, the denying of
ourselves, John v. 26; ii. 33. We must
even cease to be ourselves, and cannot be
his, except we leave off to be our own,
Matt. xvi. 24. And what shall the world
think of us all this while? <span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye not
(saith James) that the friendship of the
world is enmity with God? whosoever
therefore will be a friend of the world is
the enemy of God,”</span> James iv. 4; <span class="tei tei-q">“Let no
man deceive himself (saith Paul). If any
man among you seemeth to be wise in this
world, let him become a fool, that he may
be wise,”</span> 1 Cor. iii. 18. What do ye think
now? Are not all these hard sayings for
flesh and blood to hear? I might add
much more of this kind.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-007">[pg 7-007]</span><a name="Pg7-007" id="Pg7-007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, Thus it must be, to set the
higher value upon Christ, and upon the lot
of God's children: <span class="tei tei-q">“Will I offer burnt-offerings
to the Lord my God (saith David)
of that which doth cost me nothing”</span>? 2
Sam. xxiv. 24. And shall our lines fall to
us in pleasant places? or shall we have a
goodly heritage which doth cost us nothing?
How should the preciousness of the saint's
portion be known, if we lose nothing that
is dear to us to come by it? Phil. iii. 7,
<span class="tei tei-q">“What things were gain to me, those I
counted loss for Christ;”</span> Matt. xiii. 44-46,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure
hid in a field; the which when a man
hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven
is like unto a merchant-man seeking
goodly pearls; who, when he had found one
pearl of great price, went and sold all that
he had, and bought it.”</span> Jacob's family
must give away all the strange gods, and all
their ear-rings also (Gen. xxxv. 4), before
they get leave to build an altar unto the
Lord at Bethel; Abraham must get him
out of his country, and from his kindred, if
he will come unto the land which the Lord
will show him; Moses must forsake the
court of Egypt, if he will take him to the
heritage of Jacob his father; the disciples
must leave ships, nets, fathers, and all, if
they will follow Christ. And as they who
come in sight of the south pole lose sight of
the north pole, so, when we follow Christ,
we must resolve to forsake somewhat else,
yea, even that which is dearest to us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, If it were not so, there should
be no sure evidence of our closing in covenant
with Christ; for then, and never till
then, doth the soul give itself up to Christ
to be his, and closeth with him in a covenant,
when it renounceth all other lovers,
that it may be his only. Shall a woman be
married to a husband with the reservation of
another lover, or upon condition that she
shall ever stay in her father's house? So
the soul cannot be married to Christ, except
it not only renounce its bosom sins, lusts,
and idols, but be content also to part with
the most lawful creature-comforts for his
sake: <span class="tei tei-q">“Forget also thine own people, and
thy father's house,”</span> Psal. xlv. 10. The repudiating
of creature-comforts, and a covenant
with Christ, go hand in hand together,
Isa. lv. 2, 3. Nahash would not make a
covenant with the men of Jabesh-Gilead,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-008">[pg 7-008]</span><a name="Pg7-008" id="Pg7-008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unless they would pluck out their right eyes,
intending (as Josephus gives the reason) to
disable them from fighting or making war;
for the buckler or shield did cover their
left eye when they fought, so that they had
been hard put to it, to fight without the
right eye. This was a cruel mercy in him;
but it is a merciful severity in Christ, that
he will make no covenant with us, except
the right eye of the old man of sin in us be
put out.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
O then, let us learn from all this how
miserably many a poor soul is deluded,
imagining, as the Jews did, that Christ
shall even satisfy their carnal and earthly
desires, and that the way of salvation is
broad and easy enough. If the way of
Christ be such as you have now heard, then
surely they are far from it, who give loose
reins to the flesh, as David did to Adonijah
(1 Kings i. 6; Eccl. ii. 10); who have not
displeased their flesh at any time, nor said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why hast thou done so?”</span> who do not
withhold their heart from any joy, and
whatsoever their eyes desire, they keep it
not from them; who are like the <span class="tei tei-q">“wild ass
used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the
wind at her pleasure”</span> (Jer. ii. 24), and like
<span class="tei tei-q">“the swift dromedary, traversing her ways”</span>
(ver. 23); who cannot endure to be enclosed
into so narrow a lane as ministers describe
the way to heaven to be. These are like
fed oxen, which have room enough in the
meadows, but they are appointed for slaughter,
when the labouring oxen, which are kept
under the yoke, shall be brought home to
the stall and fed there. Was it not so with
the rich man and Lazarus? Luke xvi. 25.
Nay, and many of the children of God fall
into this same error, of making the way of
Christ broader and easier than ever Christ
made it, and taking more liberty than ever
he allowed; therefore mark ye well our Saviour's
words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Enter ye in at the strait
gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the
way, that leadeth to destruction, and many
there be which go in thereat: because strait
is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find
it,”</span> Matt. vii. 13, 14. There be but few
that seek it, and yet fewer that find it, but
fewest of all that enter in at it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But how doth all this agree with Matt.
xi. 30, <span class="tei tei-q">“For my yoke is easy, and my burden
is light;”</span> and 1 John v. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“His commandments
are not grievous.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I answer, 1. That is spoken to poor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-009">[pg 7-009]</span><a name="Pg7-009" id="Pg7-009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
souls that are labouring and heavy laden;
a metaphor taken from beasts drawing a full
cart,—which both labour in drawing, and
are weary in bearing. But my text speaketh
to those that are like undaunted heifers,
and like bullocks unaccustomed to the yoke.
The same Christ is a sweet and meek Christ
to some, but a sour and severe Christ to
others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Christ's yoke is easy in comparison of
the yoke of the law, which neither we nor
our fathers were able to bear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. As wisdom is easy to him that understandeth,
so is Christ's yoke easy, and his
burden light, to those that are well acquainted
with it, and have good experience
of it: <span class="tei tei-q">“When thou goest, thy steps
shall not be straitened; and when thou
runnest, thou shall not stumble,”</span> Prov. iv.
12: this is spoken of the way of wisdom.
But he saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“When thou goest,”</span> not
<span class="tei tei-q">“when thou beginnest,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“when thou
enterest.”</span> If thou art but once upon thy
progress, going and running, thou shalt find
the way still the easier, and still the sweeter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Mark Christ's own words: It is a
yoke, though an easy one, and a burden,
though a light one: a yoke to the flesh,
but easy to the spirit; a burden to the old
man, but light to the new man. He poureth
in wine and oil into our wounds: oil to
cherish them, and wine to cleanse them.
He can both plant us as trees of righteousness,
and at the same time lay the axe to
the root of the old tree: he will have mercy
upon the sinner, but no mercy upon the
sin; he will save the soul, but yet so as by
fire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And thus much, in general, of the difficulty
and hardship of the way of Christ,—the
great point held forth in this text;
which I have the rather insisted upon, as a
necessary foundation for those particulars
which I am to speak of. Were this principle
but rightly apprehended, it were easy to
persuade you when we come to particulars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some Papists have alleged this text for
their purgatory. Here is indeed a purgatory,
and a fire of purgatory, and such a
purgatory that we must needs go through
it before we can come to heaven. But this
purgatory is in this world, not in the world
to come. The flesh must go through it,
and not the soul separated: and it must
purge us from mortal, not from venial sins;
and by a spiritual, not a material fire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will now come to the particulars: Christ
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-010">[pg 7-010]</span><a name="Pg7-010" id="Pg7-010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is to us as a refiner's fire, and as fuller's soap,
three ways: in respect of, 1. Reformation;
2. Tribulation; 3. Mortification;—which
make not three different senses, but three
harmonious parts of one and the same sense.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I begin with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">reformation</span></span>; concerning
which I draw this doctrine from the text:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The right reformation of the church,
which is according to the mind of Jesus
Christ, is not without much molestation
and displeasure to men's corrupt nature.
It is a very purgatory upon earth: it is
like the fire to drossy silver, and like
fuller's soap to slovenly persons, who would
rather keep the spots in their garments
than take pains to wash them out.”</span><a id="noteref_1406" name="noteref_1406" href="#note_1406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1406</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Look but upon one piece of the accomplishment
of this prophecy, and by it judge
of the rest. When Christ cometh to Jerusalem,
<span class="tei tei-q">“meek, and sitting upon an ass”</span>
(as the Prophet said), all the city is troubled
at his coming, Matt. xxi. 5,10; when
he had but cast out the buyers and sellers
out of the temple, the priests and scribes
begin to plot his death, Luke xix. 45, 47;
nay, where Christ and the gospel cometh,
there is a shaking of heaven and earth,
Hag. ii. 6. The less wonder if I call reformation
like a refiner's fire. The dross of a
church is not purged away without this violence
of fire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the manner of reformation held
forth in Scripture, and that in reference,
1. To magistrates and statesmen; 2. To
ministers; 3. To a people reformed; 4. To
a people not reformed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In reference to magistrates and statesmen,
reformation is a fire that purgeth
away the dross: Isa. i. 25, <span class="tei tei-q">“And I will
turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge
away thy dross, and take away all thy tin.”</span>
Here is the refiner's fire; and the Chaldee
Paraphrase addeth the fuller's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">borith</span></span>. Then
followeth, ver. 26, <span class="tei tei-q">“And I will restore thy
judges as at the first, and thy counsellors
as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt
be called, The city of righteousness, The
faithful city.”</span> Interpreters note upon that
place, that no effectual reformation can be
looked for till rulers and magistrates be reformed;
and that therefore the Lord promiseth
to purge away the dross and tin of
corrupt rulers and judges, and to give his
people such judges and rulers as they had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-011">[pg 7-011]</span><a name="Pg7-011" id="Pg7-011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of old, Moses, Joshua, the judges, David,
Solomon, and the like.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In reference to ministers the doctrine is
most clear. The next words after my text
tell you, that this refining fire is specially
intended for purifying the sons of Levi.
The same thing we have more largely,
though more obscurely, in 1 Cor. iii. 12-15.
I do not say that the Apostle there meaneth
only of times of reformation, but this I
say, that it holdeth true, and most manifestly,
too, of times of reformation; and that
this is not to be excluded, but to be taken
in as a principal part of the Holy Ghost's
intendment in that scripture.<a id="noteref_1407" name="noteref_1407" href="#note_1407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1407</span></span></a> He is speaking
of the ministers of the gospel and their
ministry, supposing always that they build
upon Christ, and hold to that true foundation.
Upon this foundation some build
gold, silver, precious stones; that is, such
preaching of the word, such administration
of the sacraments, such a church discipline,
and such a life as is according to the word,
and savoureth of Christ: others build wood,
hay, stubble; whereby is meant whatsoever
in their ministry is unprofitable, unedifying,
vain, curious, unbeseeming the gospel; for
the ministers of Christ must be purified,
not only from heresy, idolatry, profaneness,
and the like, but even from that which is
frothy and unedifying, which savoureth not
of God's Spirit, but of man's. Now, saith
the Apostle, <span class="tei tei-q">“Every man's work shall be
made manifest, for the day shall declare it,
because it shall be revealed by fire, and the
fire shall try every man's work of what sort
it is.”</span> The church shall not always be deluded
and abused with vanities that cannot
profit. A time of light and reformation
discovereth the unprofitableness of those
things wherewith men did formerly please
and satisfy themselves. There is a fire which
will prove every man's work, even an accurate
trial and strict examination thereof, according
to the rule of Christ; a narrow inquiry
into, and exact discovery of every
man's work (for so do our divines<a id="noteref_1408" name="noteref_1408" href="#note_1408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1408</span></span></a> understand
the fire there spoken of), whether
this fiery trial be made by the searching
and discovering light of the word in a time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-012">[pg 7-012]</span><a name="Pg7-012" id="Pg7-012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of reformation, or by afflictions, or in a
man's own conscience at the hour of death.
If by some or all of these trials, a minister's
work be found to be what it ought to be, he
shall receive a special reward and praise;
but if he have built wood, hay, and stubble,
he shall be like a man whose house is set on
fire about his ears; that is, he shall suffer
loss, and his work shall be burnt, yet himself
shall escape, and get his life for a prey,
<span class="tei tei-q">“so as by fire;”</span> that is, so that he can
abide that trial and examination whereby
God distinguisheth between sincere ones
and hypocrites; or, so that he be found
to have been otherwise a faithful minister,
and to have built upon a right foundation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the third place, you shall find reformation
to be a refining fire in reference to
a people or church reformed: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that is
left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem,
shall be called holy,”</span> saith the Prophet;
<span class="tei tei-q">“when the Lord shall have washed
away the filth of the daughters of Zion,
and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem
from the midst thereof, by the spirit of
judgment, and by the spirit of burning,”</span>
Isa. iv. 3, 4. Where you may
understand<a id="noteref_1409" name="noteref_1409" href="#note_1409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1409</span></span></a>
by the filth of the daughters of Zion, their
former idolatries, and such like abominations
against the first table (which the prophets
call often by the name of filth and
pollution); and by the blood of Jerusalem,
the sins against the second table. These
the Lord promiseth to purge away by the
spirit of judgment; that is, by a spirit of
reformation (according to that John xii. 31,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now is the judgment of this world: now
shall the prince of this world be cast out”</span>).
Which spirit of reformation is also a spirit
of burning; even as the Holy Ghost is elsewhere
called fire (Matt. iii. 11), and did come
down upon the apostles in the likeness of cloven
tongues of fire (Acts ii. 3). The spirit of
reformation may be the rather called the spirit
of burning, because ordinarily reformation
is not without tribulation (as we shall hear)
and by the voice of the rod doth the Spirit
speak to men's consciences. When the
Lord hath thus washed away the filthy
spots, and burnt away the filthy dross of
his church, then (Isa. iv. 5) she becomes a
glory or a praise in the earth; and the promise
is, that <span class="tei tei-q">“upon all the glory shall be
a defence:”</span> but, you see, she is not brought
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-013">[pg 7-013]</span><a name="Pg7-013" id="Pg7-013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to that condition till she go through the refiner's
fire. It is no easy matter to cast
Satan out of a person,—how much less to
cast his kingdom out of a land? Another
place for the same purpose we find, Zech.
xiii. 9: When two parts of the land are
cut off, the remnant which escape, the third
part which is <span class="tei tei-q">“written to life in Jerusalem,”</span>
even they must be brought through
the fire. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will bring the third part
through the fire (saith the Lord), and will
refine them as silver is refined, and will try
them as gold is tried.”</span> This is the fiery
trial of affliction, but the fruit of it is a
blessed reformation, to make the church as
most pure refined gold: <span class="tei tei-q">“They shall call
on my name, and I will hear them;”</span> that
is, they shall no longer worship idols, but
me only, and they shall offer to the Lord
an offering in righteousness, which shall be
accepted. And what more? <span class="tei tei-q">“I will say
It is my people; and they shall say, The
Lord is my God.”</span> Behold, a reforming
people and a covenanting people. But he
that hath his fire in Zion, and his furnace
in Jerusalem (Isa. xxxi. 9), doth first refine
them and purify them. We are not reformed,
in God's account, till the refining
fire have purged away our dross; till we be
refined as silver is refined, and tried as gold
is tried.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, In reference to a people not reformed,
hear what the Prophet saith: Jer.
vi. 28-30, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are brass and iron; they
are all corrupters. The bellows are burnt,
the lead is consumed of the fire, the founder
melteth in vain; for the wicked are not
plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men
call them, because the Lord hath rejected
them.”</span> The Chaldee Paraphrase expoundeth
it of the prophets who laboured in vain,
and spent their strength for nought, speaking
to the people in the name of the Lord,
to turn to the law and to the testimony;
but they would not turn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I might draw many uses from this doctrine;
but I shall content myself with these
few:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, it reproveth that contrary
principle which carnal reason suggesteth:
Reformation must not grieve, but please;
it must not break nor bruise, but heal and
bind up; it must be an acceptable thing,
not displeasing; it must be <span class="tei tei-q">“as the voice of
harpers harping with their harps,”</span> but not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-014">[pg 7-014]</span><a name="Pg7-014" id="Pg7-014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“as the voice of many waters,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“as the
voice of great thunders.”</span> Thus would many
heal the wound of the daughter of Zion
slightly, and daub the wall with untempered
mortar, and so far comply with the sinful
humours and inclinations of men, as, in effect,
to harden them in evil, and to strengthen
their hands in their wickedness; or at
least, if men be moralised, then to trouble
them no farther. Saith not the Apostle,
<span class="tei tei-q">“If I yet pleased men, I should not be the
servant of Christ”</span>? Gal. i. 10; and again,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The carnal mind is enmity against God;
for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can be,”</span> Rom. viii. 7. So that
either we must have a reformation displeasing
to God, or displeasing to men. It
is not the right reformation which is not
displeasing to a Tobiah, to a Sanballat, to a
Demetrius, to the earthly-minded, to the
self-seeking politicians, to the carnal and
profane; it is but the old enmity between
the seed of the woman and the seed of the
serpent (Gen. iii. 15): nay, what if reformation
be displeasing to good men, in so far as
they are unregenerate, carnal, earthly, proud,
unmortified (for <span class="tei tei-q">“who can say, I have made
my heart clean, I am pure from my sin,”</span>
Prov. xx. 9)? What if a Joshua envy Eldad
and Medad (Num. xi. 27-29)? What
if an Aaron and a Miriam speak against
Moses (xii. 1, 2)? What if a religious Asa
be wroth with the seer (2 Chron. xvi. 10)?
What if a David will not alter his former
judgment, though very erroneous, and will
not (no, not after better information) have
it thought that he was in an error (2 Sam.
xix. 29)? What if a Jonah refuse to go
to Nineveh when he is called (Jonah i. 3)?
What if the disciples of Christ must be
taught to be more humble (Mark ix. 33-35)?
What if Peter must be reproved by
Paul for his dissimulation (Gal. ii. 11)?
What if Archippus must be admonished to
attend better upon his ministry (Col. iv.
17)? What if Christ must tell the angels
of the churches that he hath somewhat
against them (Rev. ii., iii.)? If reformation
displease both evil men, and, in some
respect, good men, this makes it no worse
than <span class="tei tei-q">“a refiner's fire;”</span> and so it must be,
if it be according to the mind of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My second and chief application shall be
unto you, my noble lords. If you be willing
to admit such a reformation as is according
to the mind of Christ, as is like the
<span class="tei tei-q">“refiner's fire”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“fuller's soap,”</span> then,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-015">[pg 7-015]</span><a name="Pg7-015" id="Pg7-015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (who
will say, ere long, to every one of you,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Give an account of thy stewardship; for
thou mayest be no longer steward,”</span> Luke
xvi. 2), I recommend these three things unto
you,—I mean, that you should make use of
this <span class="tei tei-q">“refiner's fire”</span> in reference to three
sorts of dross: 1. The dross of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">malignancy</span></em>;
2. The dross of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heresy and corruption in
religion</span></em>; 3. The dross of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">profaneness</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Touching the first of these, take the wise
counsel of the wise man, Prov. xxv. 4, 5,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Take away the dross from the silver, and
there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
Take away the wicked from before the
king, and his throne shall be established in
righteousness.”</span> Remember, also, the fourth
article of your solemn league and covenant,
by which you have obliged yourselves, with
your hands lifted up to the most high God,
to endeavour the discovery, trial, and condign
punishment of all such as have been,
or shall be incendiaries, malignants, or evil
instruments, by hindering the reformation
of religion, dividing the king from his people,
or one of the kingdoms from another,
or making any faction or parties among the
people contrary to this covenant. There
was once a compliance between the nobles of
Judah and the Samaritans, which I hope
you do not read of without abominating the
thing: You find it, Neh. vi. 17, 19, <span class="tei tei-q">“In
those days the nobles of Judah sent many
letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah
came unto them. Also (saith Nehemiah)
they reported his good deeds before
me, and uttered my words to him.”</span>
But you have also the error of a godly man
set before you as a rock to be avoided, 2
Chron. xix. 2, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shouldest thou help the
ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord?
therefore is wrath upon thee from before
the Lord.”</span> I am not to dwell upon this
point: <span class="tei tei-q">“I speak as to wise men, judge ye
what I say.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the second place, think of the extirpation
of heresy and of unsound dangerous
doctrine, such as now springeth up apace,
and subverted the faith of many. There
is no heretic nor false teacher which hath
not some one fair pretext or another; but
bring him once to be tried by this refining
fire, he is found to be <span class="tei tei-q">“like a potsherd covered
with silver dross,”</span> Prov. xxvi. 23.
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is the chaff to the wheat?”</span> saith the
Lord (Jur. xxiii. 28), and what is the dross
to the silver? If this be the way of Christ
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-016">[pg 7-016]</span><a name="Pg7-016" id="Pg7-016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which my text speaketh of, then, sure, that
which now passeth under the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“liberty
of conscience”</span> is not the way of Christ.
Much hath been written of this question;
for my part I shall, for the present, only
offer this one argument: If liberty of conscience
ought to be granted in matters of
religion, it ought also to be granted in matters
civil or military; but liberty of conscience
ought not to be granted in matters
civil or military, as is acknowledged, therefore
neither ought it to be granted in matters
of religion. Put the case: Now there
be some well-meaning men, otherwise void
of offence, who, from the erroneous persuasion
of their consciences, think it utterly
sinful, and contrary to the word of God, to
take arms in the Parliament's service, or to
contribute to this present war, or to obey
any ordinance of the lords and commons,
which tendeth to the resisting of the king's
forces. Now compare this case with the
case of a Socinian, Arminian, Antinomian,
or the like: they both plead for liberty of
conscience; they both say our conscience
ought not to be compelled, and if we do
against our conscience, we sin. I beseech
you, how can you give liberty of conscience
to the heretic, and yet refuse liberty of conscience
to him that is the conscientious recusant
in point of the war? I am sure
there can be no answer given to this argument
which will not be resolved into this
principle: Men's consciences may be compelled
for the good of the state, but not for
the glory of God; we must not suffer the
state to sink, but if religion sink we cannot
help it. This is the plain English of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I speak against liberty of conscience,
it is far from my meaning to advise
any rigorous or violent course against such
as, being sound in the faith, and holy in
life, and not of a turbulent or factious carriage,
do differ in smaller matters from the
common rule. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let that day be darkness;
let not God regard it from above, neither
let the light shine upon it”</span> (Job. iii. 4), in
which it shall be said that the children of
God in Britain are enemies and persecutors
of each other. He is no good Christian
who will not say Amen to the prayer of
Jesus Christ (John xvii. 21), that all who
are his may be one in him. If this be heartily
wished, let it be effectually endeavoured;
and let those who will choose a dividing
way rather than a uniting way bear the
blame.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-017">[pg 7-017]</span><a name="Pg7-017" id="Pg7-017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third part of my application shall be
to stir you up, right honourable, to a willing
condescending to the settling of church-government,
in such a manner, as that neither
ignorant nor scandalous persons may
be admitted to the holy table of the Lord.
Let there be, in the house of God, fuller's
soap, to take off those who are <span class="tei tei-q">“spots in your
feasts,”</span> and a refining fire to take away the
dross from the silver. Psal. cxix. 119, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
puttest away all the wicked of the earth like
dross,”</span> saith David. Take away, therefore,
the wicked from before the King of glory,
for they shall not stand before him who
hateth <span class="tei tei-q">“all workers of iniquity,”</span> Psal. v. 5.
You see God puts all profane ones in one
category, and so should you. There is a
like reason against seven, and against seventy
scandals; or, if you please to make a
catalogue of seven, you may, provided it be
such as God himself makes in the fifth verse
of this chapter, where seven sorts are reckoned
forth, as some interpreters compute;
but the last of the seven is general and comprehensive,
καὶ τοὺς φοβουμένους με, as the
Septuagint have it,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and those that fear
not me</span></span>,—those, saith one, who are called in
the New Testament ἀσεβείς,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ungodly</span></span>.
Jerome noteth upon the place,<a id="noteref_1410" name="noteref_1410" href="#note_1410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1410</span></span></a> that though
men shall not be guilty of the aforementioned
particulars, yet God makes this crime
enough, that they are ungodly. Nay, I
dare undertake to draw out of Erastus himself,
the great adversary, a catalogue of seven
sorts of persons to be kept off from
the Lord's table, and such a catalogue as
godly ministers can be content with. But
of this elsewhere.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most horribly hath the Lord's table been
profaned formerly in this kingdom, by the
admission of scandalous persons. God will
wink at it no longer,—now is the opportunity
of reformation. The Parliament of
England, if any state in the world, oweth
much to Jesus Christ; and he will take it
very ill at your hands, if ye do him not
right in this. I say do him right; for, alas!
what is it to ministers? It were more for
their ease, and for pleasing of the people, to
admit all; but a necessity is laid upon us,
that we dare not do it; and woe unto us if
we do it. And for your part, should you
not establish such a rule as may put a difference
between the precious and the vile,
the clean and the unclean, you shall in so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-018">[pg 7-018]</span><a name="Pg7-018" id="Pg7-018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
far make the churches of Christ in a worse
condition, and more disabled to keep themselves
pure, than either they were of old
under pagan emperors, or now are under
popish princes, you shall also strengthen,
instead of silencing, the objections both of
Separatists<a id="noteref_1411" name="noteref_1411" href="#note_1411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1411</span></span></a> and
Socinians,<a id="noteref_1412" name="noteref_1412" href="#note_1412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1412</span></span></a> who have, with
more than a colour of advantage, opened
their mouths wide against some reformed
churches, for their not exercising of discipline
against scandalous and profane persons,
and particularly for not suspending
them from the sacrament of the Lord's
supper. Nay, which is yet more, if you
should refuse that which I speak of, you
shall come short of that which heathens
themselves, in their way, did make conscience
of, for they did interdict and keep
off from their holy things all such as they
esteemed profane and scandalous, whom
therefore they called ἐναγεῖς, that is, accused
or delated persons. In this manner
was Alchibades excommunicate at Athens,
and Virginia at Rome, the former recorded
by Plutarch, the latter by Livius. I trust
God shall never so far desert this Parliament
as that, in this particular, pagan and
popish princes, Separatists, Socinians and
heathens shall rise up in judgment against
you. I am persuaded better things of you,
and things that accompany salvation; and,
namely, that you will not suffer the name
and truth of God to be, through you, blasphemed
and reproached.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do ye not remember the sad sentence
against Eli and his house, <span class="tei tei-q">“Because his
sons made themselves vile, and he restrained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-019">[pg 7-019]</span><a name="Pg7-019" id="Pg7-019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them not,”</span> 1 Sam. iii. 13. The Apostle
tells us, that the judgment of God abideth
not only on those that commit sin, but those
also who consent with them, Rom. i. 32.
Aquinas upon that place saith, We may consent
to the sins of others two ways: 1. Directly,
by counselling, approving, &amp;c.; 2.
Indirectly, by not hindering when we can.
And so did Eli consent to the vileness of
his sons, because, though he reproved them,
he did not restrain them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a law, Exod. xxi. 29, <span class="tei tei-q">“But if
the ox were wont to push with his horn in
time past, and it hath been testified to his
owner, and he hath not kept him in, but
that he hath killed a man or woman; the
ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall
be put to death.”</span> It could be no excuse to
say, I intended no such thing, and it is
a grief of heart to me that such mischief is
done. That which I aim at is this: The
Directory which you have lately established
saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“The ignorant and the scandalous are
not fit to receive this sacrament of the
Lord's supper;”</span> and therefore ministers are
appointed to warn all such in the name of
Christ, that they presume not to come to
that holy table. It is now desired that this,
which you have already acknowledged to be
according to the word of God and nature of
that holy ordinance, may be made effectual,
and, for that end, that the power of discipline
be added to the power of doctrine,
otherwise you are guilty, in God's sight, of
not restraining those that make themselves
vile.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the third and last place, I shall apply
my doctrine to the sons of Levi, and that in
a twofold consideration: 1. Actively; 2.
Passively.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Actively, because, if we be like our Master,
even followers of Jesus Christ, or partakers
of his unction, then our ministry will
have not only light, but fire in it,—we must
be burning as well as shining lights (John v.
35), not only shining with the light of knowledge,
and of the doctrine which is according
to godliness, but burning also with zeal for
reforming abuses, and purging of the church
from the dross thereof. Which made Augustine<a id="noteref_1413" name="noteref_1413" href="#note_1413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1413</span></span></a>
to apply propologically to ministers,
that which is said of the angels of heaven,
Psal. civ. 4, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who maketh his angels spirits;
his ministers a flaming fire.”</span> Satan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-020">[pg 7-020]</span><a name="Pg7-020" id="Pg7-020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hath many incendiaries against the kingdom
of Christ. O that we were Christ's
incendiaries against the kingdom of Satan!
If we will indeed appear zealous for the
Lord, let it not seem strange if the adversaries
of reformation say of us, as they said of
the apostles themselves, <span class="tei tei-q">“These that have
turned the world upside down are come
hither also,”</span> Acts xvii. 6. Yet it shall be
no grief of heart to us afterward, but peace
and joy unspeakable, that we have endeavoured
to do our duty faithfully.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Passively also the application must be
made, because the sons of Levi must, in the
first place, go through this refining fire
themselves, and they, most of all other men,
have need to be, and must be, refined from
their dross. I find in Scripture that these
three things had a beginning among the
priests and prophets: 1. Sin, error, and
scandal, beginneth at them, Jer. l. 6, <span class="tei tei-q">“Their
shepherds have caused them to go astray;”</span>
xxiii. 15, <span class="tei tei-q">“From the prophets of Jerusalem
is profaneness gone forth into all the
land.”</span> 2. Judgment begins at them, Ezek.
ix. 6, <span class="tei tei-q">“Slay utterly old and young,—and begin
at my sanctuary.”</span> 3. The refining work
of reformation beginneth, or ought to begin,
at the purging and refining of the sons of
Levi; so you have it in the next words after
my text, and where Hezekiah beginneth
his reformation at the sanctifying of
the priests and Levites, 2 Chron. xxix. 4,
5, &amp;c. But as it was then in Judah, it is
now in England, some of the sons of Levi
are more upright to sanctify themselves than
others. The fire that I spake of before will
prove every man and his work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am sorry I have occasion to add a third
application. But come on, and I will show
you greater things than these. What will
you say, if any be found among the sons of
Levi, that will neither be active nor passive
in the establishing of the church-refining
and sin-censuring government of Jesus
Christ, but will needs appear upon the stage
against it. This was done in a late sermon
now come abroad, which hath given no small
scandal and offence. I am confident every
other godly minister will say, let my tongue
cleave to the roof of my mouth before I do
the like.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have done with that which the text
holds forth concerning reformation. The
second way how Christ is like a refiner's
fire, and like fuller's soap, is in respect of
tribulation, which either followeth or accompanieth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-021">[pg 7-021]</span><a name="Pg7-021" id="Pg7-021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his coming into his temple. Affliction
is indeed a refining fire: Psal. lxvi. 10,
<span class="tei tei-q">“For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou
hast tried us, as silver is tried;”</span> ver. 12,
<span class="tei tei-q">“We went through fire and through water;”</span>
1 Pet. i. 6, 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are in heaviness through
manifold temptations; that the trial of your
faith, being much more precious than of
gold that perisheth, though it be tried with
fire, might be found unto praise,”</span> &amp;c. Affliction
is also the fuller's soap to purify and
make white: Dan. xi. 35; xii. 10, <span class="tei tei-q">“Many
shall be purified, and made white, and
tried;”</span> where the same word is used from
which I said before the fuller's soap hath its
name.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine shall be this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Tribulation
doth either accompany or follow after the
work of reformation or purging of the house
of God.”</span> So it was when Christ himself
came into his temple: Luke xii. 49, 51, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
am come to send fire on the earth. Suppose
ye that I am come to give peace on
earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division;”</span>—so
it was when the Apostles were
sent forth into the world: Peter applieth
to that time the words of Joel, <span class="tei tei-q">“And I
will show wonders in heaven above, and
signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire,
and vapour of smoke: the sun shall be turned
into darkness, and the moon into blood,”</span>
Acts ii. 19, 20. The meaning is, such tribulation
shall follow the gospel, which shall
be like the darkening of the great lights of the
world, and, as it were, a putting of heaven and
earth out of their course, so great a change
and calamity shall come. The experience both
of the ancient and now reformed churches
doth also abundantly confirm this doctrine.
Neither must we think that all the calamities
of the church are now overpast. Who can
be assured that that hour of greatest darkness,
the killing of the witnesses, is past,
and all that sad prophecy, Rev. xi., fulfilled?
And if some be not much mistaken,<a id="noteref_1414" name="noteref_1414" href="#note_1414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1414</span></span></a>
it is told, Dan. xii. 1, that there shall be
greater tribulation about the time of the
Jews' conversion than any we have yet seen:
<span class="tei tei-q">“At that time,”</span> saith the angel to Daniel,
<span class="tei tei-q">“there shall be a time of trouble, such as
never was since there was a nation even to
that same time: and at that time thy people
shall be delivered, every one that shall
be found written in the book.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I make haste to the uses; and, first, let
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-022">[pg 7-022]</span><a name="Pg7-022" id="Pg7-022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
me give unto God the glory of his truth.
If we have been deceived, surely he hath
not deceived us; for he hath given us plain
warning in his word, and hath not kept up
from us the worst things which ever have
or ever shall come upon his church. And
now when the sword of the Lord hath gotten
a charge against these three covenanting
and reforming kingdoms, is this any
other than the word of the Lord, that when
Christ cometh into his temple, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who may
abide the day of his coming, and who shall
stand when he appeareth? for he is like a
refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And for the invasion of Scotland by such
an enemy after a reformation, is it any new
thing? May we not say, that which is hath
been? Did not Sennacherib invade Judah
after Hezekiah's reformation? 2 Chron.
xxxii. 1. And though, after the reformation
of Asa, and after the reformation of
Jehoshaphat also (2 Chron. xiv. 9; xx. 1),
the land had a short rest and a breathing
time, yet not long after a foreign invasion
followed both upon the one reformation and
the other. Nay, look what is the worst
thing which hath befallen to Scotland as
yet;—as much, yea, worse, hath formerly
befallen to the church and people of God
toward whom the Lord had thoughts of
peace, and not of evil,—to give them an
expected end. I say it not for diminishing
anything either from the sin or shame of
Scotland; the Lord forbid:—we will bear
the indignation of the Lord, because we
have sinned against him; we will lay our
hand upon our mouth, and accept the punishment
of our iniquity; we will bear our
shame for ever, because our Father hath
spit in our face, our rock hath sold us, and
our strength hath departed from us;—but
I say it by way of answering him that reproacheth
in the gates, and by way of pleading
for the truth of God. Some have objected
to our reproach, that when the Lord
required the Israelites to appear before him
in Jerusalem thrice a year, he promised
that no man should invade their habitations
in their absence, Exod. xxxiv. 23, 24;
<span class="tei tei-q">“which gracious providence of his, no doubt
(says one<a id="noteref_1415" name="noteref_1415" href="#note_1415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1415</span></span></a>), continues still protecting all such
as are employed by his command;”</span> yet it
hath not been so with Scotland during the
time of their armies being in England. I
answer, besides that which hath been said
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-023">[pg 7-023]</span><a name="Pg7-023" id="Pg7-023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
already, even in this the word and work
of God do well agree; and that Scripture
ought not to be so applied to us, except the
Canaanites, and the Amorites, and the
Jebusites of our time had been all cast out
of our borders (we find this day too many
of them lurking there, and waiting their
opportunity); for the Septuagint, and many
of the interpreters<a id="noteref_1416" name="noteref_1416" href="#note_1416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1416</span></span></a> read that text thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“For when I shall cast out the nations before
thee, and enlarge thy borders, no man
shall desire thy land when thou shalt go up
to appear before the Lord thy God thrice
in the year:”</span> and this is the true sense,
read it as you will; for the promise is limited
to the time of casting out the nations,
and enlarging their borders (which came
not to pass till the days of Solomon). It is
certain that, from the time of making that
promise, the people had not ever liberty
and protection for keeping the three solemn
feasts in the place of the sanctuary; as
might be proved from divers foreign invasions
and spoilings of that land for some
years together; whereof we read in the book
of the Judges. But I go on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the second place, let God have the
glory of his just and righteous dealings.
Let us say with Job, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will leave my complaint
upon myself,”</span> [and say unto God,]
<span class="tei tei-q">“Show me wherefore thou contendest with
me,”</span> Job x. 1, 2. But, by all means, take
heed you conceive not an ill opinion of the covenant
and cause of God, or the reformation
of religion, because of the tribulation which
followeth thereupon. Say not it was a good
old world when we burnt incense to the
queen of heaven, <span class="tei tei-q">“for then we were well
and saw no evil.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“But (said the people
to Jeremiah) since we left off to burn incense
to the queen of heaven, and to pour
out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted
all things, and have been consumed by the
sword and by the famine,”</span> Jer. xliv. 18.
To such I answer, in the words of Solomon,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Say not thou, What is the cause that the
former days were better than these? for
thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this,”</span>
Eccl. vii. 10. Was the people's coming out
of Egypt the cause why their carcasses did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-024">[pg 7-024]</span><a name="Pg7-024" id="Pg7-024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fall in the wilderness? Or was it their
murmuring and rebelling against the Lord
which brought that wrath upon them? If
thou wilt inquire wisely concerning this
thing, read Zephaniah, chap. i. In the days
of Isaiah, even in the days of Judah's best
reformation, the Lord sent this message by
the Prophet: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will utterly consume all
things from off the land,”</span> Zeph. i. 2; <span class="tei tei-q">“And
I will bring distress upon men, that they
shall walk like blind men, because they have
sinned against the Lord: and their blood
shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh
as the dung,”</span> ver. 17. What was the reason
of it? It is plainly told them (and let
us take it all home to ourselves), because,
notwithstanding of that public reformation,
there was a remnant of Baal in the land,
and the Chemarims, and those who halt between
two opinions; who swear by the
Lord (or to the Lord, which is expounded
of the taking of the covenant in Josiah's
time), but they swear by Malcham also, ver.
4, 5. There are others who do not seek the
Lord, nor inquire after him, and many that
turn back from the Lord in a course of
backsliding (ver. 6); others clothed with
strange apparel (ver. 8); others, exercising
violence and deceit (ver. 9); a number of
atheists also, living among God's people
(ver. 12). For these and the like causes
doth the land mourn. It is not the covenant,
but the broken covenant; it is not the
reformation, but the want of a real and personal
reformation, that hath drawn on the
judgment. Blessed are they who shall keep
their garments clean, and shall be able to
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“All this is come upon us; yet have
we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt
falsely in thy covenant,”</span> Psal. xliv. 17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, Give God the glory of his wisdom.
Many are now crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“How long,
Lord? wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
shall thy wrath burn like fire?”</span> Psal.
lxxxix. 46. Your answer from God is,
that the rod shall be indeed removed, and
even cast into the fire in your stead, but
when? It shall be <span class="tei tei-q">“when the Lord hath
performed his whole work upon mount
Zion, and on Jerusalem,”</span> Isa. x. 12. If
the judgment have not yet done all the
work it was sent for, then <span class="tei tei-q">“they shall go
out from one fire, and another fire shall
devour them”</span> (Ezek. xv. 7), saith the Lord.
God is a wise refiner, and will not take the
silver out of the fire till the dross be purged
away from it. He is a wise father who will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-025">[pg 7-025]</span><a name="Pg7-025" id="Pg7-025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not cast the rod of correction till it have
driven away all that folly which is bound
up in the hearts of his children: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold,
therefore (saith the Lord) I will gather you
into the midst of Jerusalem. As they gather
silver, and brass, and iron, and lead,
and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to
blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I
gather you in mine anger and in my fury,
and I will leave you there, and melt you,”</span>
Ezek. xxii. 19, 20. He speaks it to those
who had escaped the captivity of Jehoiakim,
and also the captivity of Jehoiachin, and
thought they should be safe and secure in
Jerusalem when their brethren were in Babylon:
I will gather you, saith the Lord,
even in the midst of Jerusalem, and when
you think you are out of one furnace, you
shall fall into another; and, if you will not
be refined from your dross, you shall never
come out of that furnace, but I will melt
you there, and leave you there: which did
so come to pass; for the residue that escaped
to Egypt, and thought to shelter
themselves there, as likewise those that remained
in Jerusalem, and held out that
siege with Zedekiah,—even all these did
fall under the sword, and the famine, and
the pestilence, till they were consumed, Jer.
xxiv. 8, 10. Let those that are longest
spared take heed they be not sorest smitten.
Say not with Agag, <span class="tei tei-q">“The bitterness
of death is past.”</span> The child chastised in
the afternoon weeps as sore as the child
chastised in the forenoon. Remember the
Lord will not take away the judgment till
he have performed his work, yea, his whole
work, and that upon Mount Zion and Jerusalem
itself. It is no light matter; the
rod must be very heavy before our uncircumcised
hearts can be humbled, and the
furnace very hot before our dross depart
from us. We have need of all the sore
strokes which we mourn under, and if one
less could do the turn, it would be spared,
for the Lord doth not afflict willingly: we
ourselves rive every stroke out of his hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, in the fourth and last place, let us
give God the glory of his mercy also; he
means to do us good in our latter end. It
is the hand of a father, not of an enemy: it
is a refining, not a consuming fire. The
poor mourners in Zion are ready to say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Our bones are dried, and our hope is
lost: we are cut off for our parts”</span> (Ezek.
xxxvii. 11); we are like to lie in this fire
and furnace for ever, because our dross is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-026">[pg 7-026]</span><a name="Pg7-026" id="Pg7-026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not departed from us; we are still an unhumbled,
an unbroken, an unmortified generation;
yea, many like Ahaz, in the time
of affliction, trespassing yet more against
the Lord, many thinking of going back
again to Egypt. To such I have these two
things to say for their comfort: First,
There is a remnant which shall not only be
delivered, but purified, and shall come forth
as gold out of the fire. The third part shall
be refined, and the Lord shall say, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
my people,”</span> Zech xiii. 9. And a most sweet
promise there is after the saddest denunciation
of judgment: Ezek. xiv. 22, 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet,
behold, therein shall be left a remnant that
shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters;
behold, they shall come forth unto
you, and ye shall see their ways and their
doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning
the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem,
even concerning all the evil that I
have brought upon it. And they shall comfort
you, when ye see their ways and their
doings: and ye shall know that I have not
done without cause all that I have done in
it, saith the Lord God;”</span> Dan. xii. 10,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Many shall be purified, and made white,
and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly:
and none of the wicked shall understand;
but the wise shall understand.”</span> After the
promise of delivering those that were carried
away to Babylon, there is another promise
added of that which was much better:
Jer. xxiv. 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will give them an heart
to know me, that I am the Lord; and they
shall be my people, and I will be their God;
for they shall return unto me with their
whole heart;”</span> Psal. cxxx. 8, <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall
redeem Israel from all his iniquities;”</span>
Zeph. iii. 12, 13, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will also leave in the
midst of thee an afflicted and poor people,
and they shall trust in the name of the
Lord. The remnant of Israel shall not do
iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful
tongue be found in their mouth.”</span>
Let your souls now apply these and the
like promises, and cry, Lord, remember
thy promise, and let not a jot of thy good
word fall to the ground. Secondly, As the
promises of spiritual and eternal blessings,
so the promises of peace and temporal deliverances
are not legal, but even evangelical.
If we be not refined and purged as
we ought to be, that is a matter of humiliation
to us, but it is also a matter of magnifying
the riches of free mercy: Isa. xlviii.
9-11, <span class="tei tei-q">“For my name's sake will I defer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-027">[pg 7-027]</span><a name="Pg7-027" id="Pg7-027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain
for thee, that I cut thee not off. Behold,
I have refined thee, but not with silver;
I have chosen thee in the furnace of
affliction. For mine own name's sake, even
for mine own sake, will I do it.”</span> The Lord
is there arguing with his people, to humble
them, to convince them, and to cut off all
matter of glorying from them; and among
other things, lest they should glory in this,
that whatever they were before, they became
afterward as silver refined seven times
in the furnace:<a id="noteref_1417" name="noteref_1417" href="#note_1417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1417</span></span></a> Nay, saith the Lord, I
have refined you in some sort, but not as
silver, not so as that you are clean from
your dross; but I have chosen you, and set
my love upon you, even while you are in
the furnace not yet refined; and I will deliver
you, even for my own name's sake,
that you may owe your deliverance for ever
to free mercy, and not to your own repentance
and amendment. A land is accepted,
and a people's peace made with God, not
by their repentance and humiliation, but by
Christ believed on: Mic. v. 5, <span class="tei tei-q">“This man
shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall
come into our land.”</span> There were sin-offerings
and burnt-offerings appointed in the
law for a national atonement (Lev. iv., xiii.,
xxi.; Num. xv. 25, 26) which did typify
pardoning of national sins through the merit
of Jesus Christ. We must improve the
office of the Mediator, and the promise of
free grace, in the behalf of God's people, as
well as of our own souls, which, if it be indeed
done, will not hinder, but further a
great mourning and deep humiliation in the
land. And so much of tribulation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third thing held forth in this text
(of which I must be very short) is mortification.
This also is a refining fire: Matt.
iii. 11, <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall baptise you with the
Holy Ghost, and with fire;”</span> Mark ix. 49,
<span class="tei tei-q">“For every one shall be salted with fire,
and every sacrifice shall be salted with
salt.”</span> He hath been before speaking of
mortification, of the plucking out of the
right eye, the cutting off the right hand,
or the right foot, and now he presseth the
same thing by a double allusion to the law,—there
was a necessity both of fire and
salt; the sacrifice was seasoned with salt
(Lev. ii. 13), and the fire upon the altar
was not to be put out, but every morning
the wood was burnt upon it, and the burnt-offering
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-028">[pg 7-028]</span><a name="Pg7-028" id="Pg7-028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
laid upon it (Lev. vi. 12, 13). So
if we will present ourselves as a holy and
acceptable sacrifice to God, we must be seasoned
with the salt, and our corruptions
burnt up with the fire of mortification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine shall be this: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not
enough to join in public reformation, yea,
to suffer tribulation for the name of Christ,
except we also endeavour mortification.”</span>
This mortification is a third step distinct
from the other two, and without this the
other two can make us but <span class="tei tei-q">“almost Christians,”</span>
or, <span class="tei tei-q">“not far from the kingdom of
God.”</span> In the parable of the sower and the
seed, as we find it both in Matthew (chap.
xiii.), Mark (chap, iv.), and Luke (chap,
viii.), this method may be observed, That
of the four sorts of ground, the second is
better than the first, the third better than
the second, but the fourth only is the good
ground, which is fruitful, and getteth a blessing.
Some men's hearts are like the highway,
and the hardbeaten road, where every
foul spirit, and every lust hath walked and
conversed, their consciences, through the
custom of sin, are, as it were, <span class="tei tei-q">“seared with
a hot iron;”</span> in these the word takes no place,
but all that they bear doth presently slip
from them. Others receive the word with
a present good affection and delight, but
have no depth of earth; that is, neither
having had a work of the law upon their
consciences for deep humiliation, nor being
rooted and grounded in love to the gospel,
nor, peradventure, so much as grounded in
the knowledge of the truth, nor having
counted their cost, and solidly resolved for
suffering; thereupon it comes to pass, when
suffering times come, these wither away,
and come to nothing. There is a third sort,
who go a step farther; they have some root,
and some more solid ground than the former,
so that they can suffer many things,
and not fall away because of persecution,
yet they perish through want of mortification.
One may suffer persecution for
Christ, not being sore tried in that which is
his idol lust, yet enduring great losses and
crosses in other things: of such it is said,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness
of riches, and the lusts of other
things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh
unfruitful,”</span> Mark iv. 19. Mark that,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the lusts of other things;”</span> that is, whether
it be the lust of the eyes, or the lust of the
flesh, or the pride of life; and he speaks of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“entering in;”</span> meaning of some strong
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-029">[pg 7-029]</span><a name="Pg7-029" id="Pg7-029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tentation coming upon a man to catch him
in that which is the great idol of his heart,
and his beloved lust, whatever it be; such a
tentation he never found before, and therefore
thought the lust had been mortified,
which was but lurking. Did not Judas suffer
many things with Christ during the time
of his public ministry? Did not Ananias
and Sapphira suffer, for a season, with the
apostles and church at Jerusalem? What
was it then that lost them? They neither
made defection from the profession of the
truth, nor did they fall away because of persecution;
but having shined in the light a
sound profession, having also taken up the
cross, and borne the reproach of Christ,
they made shipwreck at last upon an unmortified
lust.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall enlarge the doctrine no further,
but touch upon some few uses, and so an
end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, Let all and every one of us be convinced
of the necessity of our further endeavouring
after mortification. The best silver
which cometh out of the earth hath dross in
it, and therefore needeth the refiner's fire;
and the whitest garment that is worn will
touch some unclean thing or other, and
therefore will need the fuller's soap. The
best of God's children have the dross of
their inherent corruptions to purge away;
which made Paul say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I keep under my
body, and bring it unto subjection; lest
that by any means, when I have preached
to others, I myself should be a castaway,”</span>
1 Cor. ix. 27. It is a speech borrowed from
reprobate silver which is not refined from
dross, and so is the word used by the Septuagint,
Isa. i. 22, τὸ ἀργύριον ἰμῶν ἀδόκιμον
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thy silver is become dross.”</span> The Apostle
therefore sets himself to the study of
mortification, lest, saith he, when I have
been refining and purifying others, I myself
be found to be drossy silver. And as there
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inherent</span></em> dross, so there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adherent</span></em> uncleanness
in the best; and who can say
that he hath kept his garments so clean
that he is <span class="tei tei-q">“unspotted of the world”</span> (Isa. i.
27), or that he hath so separated himself
from the pollutions of the world as that he
hath touched no unclean thing: so that
there is an universal necessity of making
use both of the refiner's fire, and of the
fuller's soap.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, Let us once become willing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7-030">[pg 7-030]</span><a name="Pg7-030" id="Pg7-030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and contented, yea, desirous to be thoroughly
mortified. A man's lusts and corruptions
are indeed so strongly interested
in himself, and his corruptions are his members,
therefore, when we leave off sin, we
are said to live no more <span class="tei tei-q">“to ourselves,”</span>
2 Cor. v. 15; and mortification is the greatest
violence that can be done to nature,
therefore it is called a cutting off of the
chief members of the body (Mark ix. 43,
45, 47), a salting with salt, and a burning
with fire (ver. 49), a circumcision (Col. ii.
11), a crucifying (Rom. vi. 6): so that nothing
can be more difficult or displeasing,
yea, a greater torment to flesh and blood.
Yet now art thou willing, notwithstanding
of all this, to take Christ on his own terms?
to take him not only for righteousness and
life, but to take him as a refiner's fire, and
as fuller's soap? O that there were such a
heart in thee! When Christ bids thee pluck
out thy right eye, and cut off thy right
hand, say not in thy heart, How shall I do
without my right eye, and my right hand?
Nay, thou shalt do well enough, thou shalt
even enter into life without them, thou
shalt be a gainer, and no loser. Say not
thou, How shall I go through this refining
fire? Fear not, thou shall lose nothing but
thy dross. Thus get thy heart wrought to
a willingness, and a condescending, in the
point of mortification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, If you say, But after all this, how
shall I attain unto it? Put thyself in the
hands of Jesus Christ, trust him with the
work; if you mark the text here, and the
verse that followeth, Christ is both the refiner,
and the refiner's fire: thou shalt be
refined by him, and thou shalt be refined
in him. Thou deceivest thyself if thou
thinkest to be refined any other way but
by this refiner, and in this refiner's fire.
The blood of Christ doth not only wash us
from guilt, but purge our consciences <span class="tei tei-q">“from
dead works, to serve the living God,”</span> Heb.
ix. 14; <span class="tei tei-q">“And they that are Christ's, have
crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts.”</span> Gal. v. 24. Here you may see the
thing is feasible and attainable, and not only
by an apostle or some extraordinary man,
but by all that are Christ's. Being his,
and in him, they are enabled, through his
strength, to crucify the flesh, with the affections
and lusts thereof.

wrote a book to prove that all those in the reformed churches of
Poland, who desire to be truly godly, ought to separate themselves, and

is this, because, in those reformed churches, there
is a great neglect of church discipline, whereby it
cometh to pass that scandalous persons are admitted
to the Lord's table. The same argument is
pressed against some Lutheran churches by Schlichtingius,
